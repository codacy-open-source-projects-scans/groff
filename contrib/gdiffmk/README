gdiffmk is approximately a recreation of the original Bell Labs/AT&T diffmk
command for troff/nroff documents, with enhancements.

It should not be confused with 'diffmk' commands that operate on XML.

The inspiration for this code was a Perl 2 version written in 1989 by Randal
L. Schwartz.  See
  landfield.com/software/comp.sources.misc/archive-name/volume06/diffmk.p.gz

The command also attempts to reproduce some of the functionality of the old
'nrchbar' command.  See
  open-systems.ufl.edu/mirrors/ftp.isc.org/usenet/comp.sources.unix/volume10/nrchbar.Z

Thanks to Werner Lemberg for help in making the package more portable and
fit into the GNU groff source structure.

GNU diff(1) with the -Dname option does all of the work and sed(1)
translates the output into something groff/troff/nroff can handle.

Note the BUGS on the man page.

The 'tests' directory contains simple tests.  'runtests.sh' runs them
and compares the output against baseline files.
