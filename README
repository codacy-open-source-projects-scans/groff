This is the "groff" document formatting system, a reimplementation and
extension of the AT&T "troff" typesetting system for Unix operating
systems.  The version number is given in the file ".tarball-version" if
you are building from a distribution archive; otherwise, building from
its Git repository stores it in the file ".version".

The groff system includes original implementations (not derived from
AT&T code) of the "troff", "nroff", "pic", "eqn", "tbl", "refer", and
"soelim" programs; the "man" and "ms" macro packages; and output drivers
for PostScript, PDF, and TeX DVI file formats, HP LaserJet 4- and Canon
CaPSL-compatible printers, HTML and XHTML (in beta status), and
typewriter/terminal devices.

It also provides modified versions of BSD Unix additions to AT&T troff:
the "grn" preprocessor, and the "mdoc" and "me" macro packages.
"gxditview", an enhanced version of the X11 "xditview" previewer for
"troff" device-independent output, originates in X11R5.

Contributed components feature Joergen Haegg's reimplementation and
extension of the DWB troff "mm" macro package, Peter Schaffter's "mom"
macro package, and Bernd Warken's reimplementation of the "chem"
preprocessor in Perl.

See the file "INSTALL.extra" for instructions on how to install from a
distribution archive, such as a release or release candidate.

The file "INSTALL.REPO" contains supplementary instructions for building
directly from a clone of the Git repository.

The file "NEWS" contains a history of user-visible changes to groff.

groff is free software.  See the file "COPYING" for overall copying
permissions, and "LICENSES" for further detail.

The file "PROBLEMS" describes various issues that users have encountered
in compiling, installing, and running groff.

The file "MORE.STUFF" describes some third-party programming and
documentary resources useful with groff.

Current and historical releases of groff are available via HTTPS and
anonymous FTP from the host "ftp.gnu.org" in the directory "gnu/groff".

groff has a home page at the GNU Project.

https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/

Administration of the project is done through GNU Savannah.

  https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=groff

groff is developed at its Git repository, which has a web interface.

  https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/groff.git

You can view any commit in isolation, and browse the entire source tree
corresponding to its state as of that commit.  Click the summary line of
the commit message to expose these options.

The files "INSTALL.extra" and "INSTALL.REPO" files noted above discuss
build requirements.  groff also has runtime dependencies.

Creation of PDF and (X)HTML output requires Ghostscript.  Production of
(X)HTML furthermore demands tools from the Netpbm package.

Production of PDF output using the "gropdf" output driver requires Perl.
(You can alternatively produce PostScript with "grops" and convert that
to PDF using Ghostscipt.)  The "chem", "gperl", and "gpinyin"
preprocessors, and several utilities, such as "grog", are also written
in Perl.

If groff is configured with "lp" or "lpr" support, the corresponding
program must remain available on the system for the groff command's
"-l" option to work.  Similarly, build-time detection of development
headers for the "uchardet", "Xaw", and "Xmu" libraries (and their
dependencies) assumes that their runtime counterparts remain installed
to support the groff that is built.

You can view or add to groff's bug database via its issue tracker on the
Savannah site (also linked from the groff home page).

  http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=groff

To report a problem, you may use the form in the file "BUG-REPORT"; its
purpose is to make sure that groff's developers have the information
they need to fix the bug.  At least read the "BUG-REPORT" file and
supply all the information that it asks for.  Even if you are not sure
that something is a bug, please report it so we can determine whether it
is a software defect, or an omission from our documentation.

If you'd like to modify groff or participate in its development, files
"HACKING" and "MANIFEST" can familiarize you with the structure of the
code and the project's conventions for maintaining it.

Four mailing lists are available.

  bug-groff@gnu.org          a read-only list for following bug reports
  groff@gnu.org              for general discussion of groff
  groff-commit@gnu.org       a read-only list for following commits
                             to the Git repository
  info-groff@gnu.org         a moderated list for groff-related
                             announcements

To subscribe, send a mail to <list>-request@<domain> (example:
groff-request@gnu.org for the groff list) with the word "subscribe"
in either the subject or body of the email (don't include the quotes).
Alternatively, subscribe via our web pages by completing an HTML form.
