.SH Description
.\" The seemingly casual text below is crafted so that one can visually
.\" verify the presence or absence of adjustment.
.\"   groff <= 1.23 defaults: BP=7n, LL=78n (BP didn'"'"'t exist yet)
.\"   groff >  1.23 defaults: BP=5n, LL=80n
Let us measure our degree of gruntlement.
.P
.ad l
First, align output to the left.
A dubious practice,
to be sure,
but the house style of Perl man pages to date.
.IR pod2man (1)
from podlators\~6.0
employs
.I groff
1.23'"'"'s
.B AD
string.
.TP
Seventh Edition Unix
had the same preference in
.I nroff
mode in 1979,
and did not adjust the text to both margins on terminals
(using the
.B na
request),
though it did when using a typesetter.
.TP
SunOS
commented out the disablement of adjustment as early as its 2.0 release
(1982),
and appears to have retained that all the way through Solaris 10.
.P
As of
.I groff
1.24,
paragraphing macros reset the adjustment mode to the default configured
by the user,
or by the document if the user did not configure one.
.P
Due to differences between implementations,
between
.I nroff
and
.I troff
modes,
and to the surprising behavior of the request sequence
.IP
.EX
\&.ad l
\&.na
\&.ad
.EE
.P
no useful idioms for use of the
.B ad
request
in man pages have arisen.
