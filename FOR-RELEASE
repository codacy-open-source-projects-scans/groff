This file describes how to prepare 'groff' for a new release.


########################################################################

* Update 'grog' to include the names of new GNU troff requests and macro
  names unique to packages (and sufficiently heavily used in typical
  documents).

* Update font description files that we generate from external data and
  provide with our source distribution.

    Directory  Format                  Tool
    ---------  ------                  ----
    devX*      X11 core/server font    xtotroff

  The make(1) target "maintainer-font-descriptions" produces these font
  descriptions.

* Retrieve current versions of 'UnicodeData.txt'[1] and the Adobe Glyph
  List (AGL)[2], and use them with
  'src/utils/afmtodit/make-afmtodit-tables' to update
  'src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.tables'.

  [1] E.g., <https://www.unicode.org/Public/15.0.0/ucd/UnicodeData.txt>.
      Check for the latest _released_ version of Unicode at the time.
      Data for the forthcoming release may be available.
  [2] <https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/agl-aglfn/blob/master/\
      glyphlist.txt>

     (<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adobe-type-tools/agl-aglfn/\
     master/glyphlist.txt> may be more convenient.)

* Use the same 'UnicodeData.txt' file as input to
  'src/libs/libgroff/make-uniuni' to regenerate
  'src/libs/libgroff/uniuni.cpp'.

* Update the 'gnulib' sub-module and 'bootstrap' script to the latest
  stable versions.  See the 'HACKING' file for instructions.

* Update the release version number where it is hard-coded or
  represented as "next".
  + NEWS (append "release candidate" as applicable)
  + arch/mingw/grap2graph.cmd
  + doc/webpage.ms (only for final release)

* If the major or minor version number is being incremented, split off
  a historical ChangeLog file and add it to `EXTRA_DIST` in Makefile.am.

* Update in 'src/roff/groff/groff.cpp' the 'printf' that displays the
  copyright to include the current year if it is not present.  (If no
  copyrightable changes to the project's code have been made in the
  current calendar year, use the most recent year in which they have;
  see the 'HACKING' file.)

* Run the "set-man-page-time-stamps" Makefile target from your build
  directory to fix up the stamps on the man pages.

* Build (and test!) a distribution archive with "make distcheck".  It's
  not a good idea for any tests to be failing, but if they are, note the
  fact prominently in the release notes.

* Increment the version number by tagging the release, beta, or release
  candidate.  Sign the tag.  groff requires an explicit three-part
  version, major.minor.revision, due to the .Y register.  Push this
  signed tag to the repository.

    $ git tag -s -m 'release candidate 1.24.0.rc2' 1.24.0.rc2
    $ git push origin tag 1.24.0.rc2

* Build and test a distribution archive again with "make distcheck".
  It's important to do this so that the archive unpacks to an
  appropriately named source directory.  It's even more important after
  tagging a first release candidate, because doing so increments the
  version number visible in installed file names (such as
  "/usr/share/groff/1.24.0").

* For final releases, update the groff home page.

* Make an announcement per the "ANNOUNCE" file.

* groff 1.24.0: Revise the sentence "Most commands installed by groff
  recognize this option." to say "All".
