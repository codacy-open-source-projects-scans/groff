2026-02-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Stop using `${1+"$@"}` to kludge around old broken shells.

	The (forthcoming) Autoconf 2.73 manual explains.

	---snip---
	You may see usages like ‘${1+"$@"}’ in older shell scripts
	designed to work around a portability problem in ancient shells.
	Unfortunately this runs afoul of bugs in more-recent shells, and
	nowadays it is better to use plain ‘"$@"’ instead.

	The portability problem with ancient shells was significant.
	When there are no positional arguments ‘"$@"’ should be
	discarded, but the original Unix version 7 Bourne shell
	mistakenly treated it as equivalent to ‘""’ instead, and many
	ancient shells followed its lead.

	For many years shell scripts worked around this portability
	problem by using ‘${1+"$@"}’ instead of ‘"$@"’, and you may see
	this usage in older scripts.  Unfortunately, ‘${1+"$@"}’ does
	not work with ‘ksh93’ M 93t+ (2009) as shipped in AIX 7.2
	{2015}, as this shell drops a trailing empty argument:

	  $ set a b c ""
	  $ set ${1+"$@"}
	  $ echo $#
	  3

	Also, ‘${1+"$@"}’ does not work with Zsh 4.2.6 (2005) and
	earlier, as shipped in Mac OS X releases before 10.5, as this
	old Zsh incorrectly word splits the result:

	  zsh $ emulate sh
	  zsh $ for i in "$@"; do echo $i; done
	  Hello World
	  !
	  zsh $ for i in ${1+"$@"}; do echo $i; done
	  Hello
	  World
	  !
	---end snip---

	In light of all this winning by elite shell developers,
	use plain, idiomatic `"$@"` instead, relying on downstream
	distributors to patch the handful of occurrences in groff should
	their deployments be boxed in by a buggy /bin/sh.

	* font/devpdf/util/BuildFoundries.pl (LoadFoundry): Clarify
	diagnostic messages.  A digital font, like
	"URWGothic-DemiOblique.t1", is not the same thing as font
	description file for groff, like "ABI".  We do our users no
	favors by conflating these two concepts.

2026-02-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/devpdf/util/BuildFoundries.pl (LoadFoundry): Tweak
	warning diagnostic to describe the decision being taken and the
	reason for it.  Set `notFoundFont` scalar to 1 only if this
	diagnostic was unexpected because the `urwfontsupport` scalar
	didn't match "no".  This way we don't spray the (usually
	enormous) "path(s) used for searching" diagnostic for no
	apparent reason.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description): Fix assertion
	failures (potential and actual) by supplying descriptions even
	of internally generated token types.  While a user _should_
	never be exposed to these in a diagnostic message, the event is
	not impossible (and said descriptions could be helpful to groff

2026-01-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/devpdf/util/BuildFoundries.pl (LoadFoundry): Tweak
	wording of warning diagnostic; favor "cannot" over "unable to"

	(RunAfmtodit): Clarify warning diagnostic: this script _could_
	pass unrecognized options to afmtodit(1); it _chooses_ not to.
	Also use the word "option" instead of "flag"--not all of

	Propagate "configure" shell variable `urwfontsupport` into
	"BuildFoundries" script, quieting build-time warnings when URW
	font support is explicitly deconfigured.

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_URW_FONTS_SUPPORT): `AC_SUBST`
	`urwfontsupport` so that it is defined in Makefiles.
	* font/devpdf/devpdf.am (BuildFoundries): Add `urwfontsupport`
	to set of sed(1) substitutions performed when generating target.
	* font/devpdf/util/BuildFoundries.pl: Add `urwfontsupport`
	scalar, taking value of corresponding sed substituion.
	(LoadFoundry): Suppress warning about unavailable font if
	`urwfontsupport` matches "no".

2026-01-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_URW_FONTS_CHECK): Stop emptying shell
	variable `urwfontsdir` if the URW fonts aren't found.  This
	variable _had_ been used both to store the directory where they
	were found _and_ as an indicator of whether URW font support was
	expected by the configuring user.  We now have `urwfontsupport`
	for the latter purpose, and blanking out `urwfontsdir` had the
	undesirable side effect of suppressing the message that the
	`GROFF_URW_FONTS_NOTICE` macro emits, preventing notification of
	the user that their intention to configure URW font support was
	foiled.

2026-01-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: Identify the report at the end of the

	* gnulib: Refresh stable/2026-01 branch to obtain commit

2026-01-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/groff.texi.in: Adapt manual content to the configured
	groff command prefix.  If the build is configured without a
	leading "g"--omitting it has been groff's default for many
	years, possibly forever--then our Texinfo manual now omits that
	prefix when mentioning the affected commands (all replacements
	for AT&T troff commands).  This way, if you select a command
	prefix, say "limbo", and rebuild the Texinfo manual, the
	manual reflects the prefix used by your build configuration, and
	talks about "limboeqn", "limbotroff", "limborefer", and so on.

2026-01-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* arch/mingw/grap2graph.cmd: Revise version info.
	- Drop "GNU" from reported version string; this is a contributed

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_URW_FONTS_SUPPORT): New Autoconf macro
	creates a "with" configuration option, permitting the host
	environment to easily switch off the search for URW fonts and
	defeat all of the consequent features without the "configure"
	script issuing a lengthy warning about failure to find the
	aforementioned fonts.  New shell variable `urwfontsupport`
	indicates the configuration's desired status (which still
	defaults on).
	(GROFF_URW_FONTS_CHECK): Add dependency on the foregoing macro.
	Initialize `urwfontsdir` shell variable to empty
	unconditionally, permitting it to be updated later if the URW
	font feature isn't disabled.  Nest most of the work of this
	macro inside a conditional on `urwfontsupport`.  Continue to
	unconditionally populate and `AC_SUBST`-itute
	`groff_have_urw_fonts` and `urwfontsdir`, because
	"configure.ac", "test-mom.sh.in", "mom.am",
	"font/devpdf/Foundry.in", "devpdf.am", and
	"check-urw-foundry.sh.in" variously rely on them to behave

	Define `*_builddir` macros without interpolating `top_builddir`.
	groff does not use recursive make; all file specifications are
	resolved relative to the top of the build tree, so the
	interpolation is unnecessary, and with BSD Make it causes
	spurious failures because that implementation uses strings, not
	file identities, as the nodes of its dependency graph.  So if
	you ask for "foo" to be built but have only a rule for a target

2026-01-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.1.man (Usage): Drop references to
	Keith Marshall's "pdfmark" macro package; it is now maintained
	separately from groff, and some of the claims had become stale.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67911>.  Thanks to Bjarni
	Ingi Gislason for the report.

2026-01-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[pic]: Improve fix for Savannah #67899.

	* src/preproc/pic/lex.cpp (interpolate_macro_with_args): Shift
	more logic inside the `!ignore` conditional; this way we
	correctly handle the case of a non-empty 33rd macro argument.
	We were no longer smashing the stack with a list of pointers of
	user-controlled length, but we were permitting the stack memory
	at a location one past the end of the `argv` array to be
	written to.

	Continues fixing <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67899>.

2026-01-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/groff.cpp (main): Bump ending year of copyright
	notice to 2026 to reflect (presumably) copyrightable changes in
	the source tree as a whole since December 31.  See "Updating
	Copyright Notices" in our "HACKING" file.

2026-01-01  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Rename `ptr` request to `pwh`.

	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (init_div_requests): Do it.
	* tmac/troffrc (ptr): Define macro advising user to migrate.
	Invoke `pwh`.

	* doc/groff.texi.in (Page Location Traps, The Implicit Page
	Trap, Debugging):
	* man/groff.7.man (Request short reference, Page location traps,
	Debugging):
	* man/groff_diff.7.man (New requests, Debugging): Update
	documentation.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67880>.

2026-01-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[pic]: Fix Savannah #67899.

	* src/preproc/pic/lex.cpp (interpolate_macro_with_args): Shift
	test of argument count so that it is performed for empty
	arguments as well as populated ones.  The misplacement of the
	test made it possible to defeat that test by supplying an empty
	32nd argument to a macro, consequently overrunning stack storage
	allocated for this function's local `argv` array.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67899>.  Thanks to John de
	Armas for the report and a reproducer, based on the
	"jumperblock" example from our "doc/pic.ms" file.  Problem
	appears to date back to groff's birth.

2026-01-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Continues commit 3f783091f0, 19 December 2024.

2026-01-02  Helmut Grohne <helmut@subdivi.de>

	* src/libs/libgroff/libgroff.am (install_charset_data): Don't
	ship a "charset.alias" file if it's empty or contains nothing
	but comments.  Such files, a common product of certain gnulib
	internals, aggrieve a Debian packaging assistance tool.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67886>.

2026-01-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/groff_mdoc.7.man (Other possible pitfalls): Advise
	composers of mdoc(7) documents to use `\-` for copy-and-pastable
	hyphen-minus characters.

2026-01-01  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/preconv/preconv.cpp (conversion_iconv): Use
	`const_cast<>` to cast away `const`, not `static_cast<>`.  Fixes
	build on Solaris 11/sparc64/GCC 5.5.  Problem introduced by me
	in commit 1740c22b4a, 11 July.  Thanks to Bruno Haible for the
	clue.

2025-12-31  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (do_divert): Shift checks resulting in
	error diagnostics, including a fatal one, later in the logic.
	It's not a problem to close a diversion of mismatched "boxing"
	{see Savannah #67139} when the diversion stack is empty.  We can
	simply emit a warning as groff 1.23.0 and earlier did.
	Continues commit 251115ed5a, 19 May.

2025-12-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Work on Savannah #67735.

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (struct node):
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (class break_char_node)
	(node::get_break_code): Demote type of hyphenation codes from
	`int` to `unsigned char`, since the range of the latter is as
	much as has ever been stored in them anyway.  (This was
	discovered the hard way in Savannah #66919.)  Retype
	`break_code` and `prev_break_code` private member variables and
	`get_break_code()` public member function accordingly.

2025-12-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Improve type-correctness (slightly).

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp: Define globals `hresolution`,
	`vresolution`, and `units_per_inch` as having `units` type
	rather than `int`.  This is merely _documentary_
	type-correctness, however, as `units` isn't strongly typed, but
	only a slovenly `typedef` alias of `int`.
	* src/roff/troff/troff.h: Align declarations with foregoing
	definitions.

2025-12-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp: Fix code style nits.
	(font_info::set_bold)
	(troff_output_file::fill_color): Parenthesize formally complex
	expressions.
	(tfont::tfont)
	(real_output_file::~real_output_file)
	(zero_width_node::tprint)
	(translate_font): Explicitly compare value of pointer type to
	null pointer literal instead of letting it pun down to a
	Boolean.
	(translate_font)
	(configure_track_kerning)
	(constantly_space_font): Drop unnecessary parentheses from
	expression.

2025-12-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.

	* src/roff/troff/div.h: Rename declaration `cleanup_and_exit()`
	to `write_any_trailer_and_exit()`.  Comment formal argument
	name as a compromise with the Stroustrup-style C++ used in most
	of groff.
	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (cleanup_and_exit): Rename this...
	(write_any_trailer_and_exit): ...to this.
	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (top_level_diversion::begin_page):
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (exit_troff, abort_request, do_error)
	(fatal_with_file_and_line): Migrate call sites.

2025-12-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	(terminal_message_request)
	(terminal_message1_request)

	(init_input_requests): Update wire-uppery.

2025-12-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor for clarity.  "asciify" is one of
	the code base's more overloaded terms.  Rename one application
	of it.

	* src/roff/troff/token.h: Rename `asciify()` and relocate its
	declaration from here...
	* src/roff/troff/input.h: ...to here, as
	`encode_for_stream_output()`.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (asciify): Rename this definition...
	(encode_for_stream_output): ...to this.

	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp
	(top_level_diversion::transparent_output):
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp:

	(stream_write_request)
	(stream_write_continuation_request):
	(stream_write_macro_request): ...to these.
	(init_input_requests): Update wire-uppery.

2025-12-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_terminal): Fix code style nits.
	Parenthesize formally complex expressions.  Arrange equality
	comparisons to avoid inadvertent lvalue assignment.

2025-12-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Fix code style nits.
	(do_terminal, terminal, terminal1, terminal_continue)
	(do_write_request, write_request, write_request_continue)
	(write_macro_request): Mark functions `static` since they do not
	require external linkage.
	(do_terminal): Demote argument types from `int` to `bool`.
	Rename them from `newline` and `string_like` to
	`do_append_newline` and `interpret_leading_spaces`.
	(terminal, terminal1, terminal_continue): Update call sites to
	use Boolean rather than integer literals.
	(do_write_request): Demote argument type from `int` to `bool`.
	Rename it from `newline` to `do_append_newline`.
	(write_request, write_request_continue): Update call sites to
	use Boolean rather than integer literals.

2025-12-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (process_macro_package_argument):
	Clarify fatal diagnostic message.

2025-12-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Slightly refactor.

	* src/roff/troff/env.h: Rename `want_break` global Boolean,
	relocating its declaration from here...
	* src/roff/troff/input.h: ...to here, as
	`was_invoked_with_regular_control_character`.  Yes, it's a
	mouthful, but it is the task of the request handlers, which are
	input processing functions, to interpret *roff's two distinct
	control characters, giving them one of them break suppression
	semantics.
	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (begin_page, space_request)
	(flush_request):
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (fill, no_fill, center, right_justify)
	(indent, temporary_indent)
	(break_without_forced_adjustment_request)
	(break_with_forced_adjustment_request):
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (process_input_stack)
	(macro_iterator::macro_iterator)
	(unsafe_transparent_throughput_file_request)
	(transparent_throughput_file_request): Update dereference sites.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Update definition.
	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp: Include local "input.h" header file to
	get at the symbol's relocated declaration.

2025-12-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp: Refactor.  Further separate input
	processing logic from engine logic.
	(environment::do_break): Rename argument from `want_adjustment`
	to `want_forced_adjustment` for clarity.
	(break_output_line): Stop checking value of `want_break` global
	here, as that's determined by the input control character used
	to invoke the request, a front-end rather than an engine concern
	{albeit brearing an engine-oriented name}.  However, removing
	that conditional leaves this function as a one-liner with two
	call sites differing only by a Boolean literal argument, so drop
	the function altogether, instead open-coding it...
	(break_without_adjustment, break_without_adjustment): ...here.

2025-12-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[groff]: Unit-test `br` and `brp` requests.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/br-and-brp-requests-work.sh: Do it.
	* src/roff/groff/groff.am (groff_TESTS): Run test.

2025-12-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp: Trivially refactor.
	(break_output_line): Rename argument from `want_adjustment` to
	`want_forced_adjustment` for clarity.
	(break_without_adjustment): Rename this request handler...
	(break_without_forced_adjustment_request): ...to this.
	(break_with_adjustment): Rename this request handler...
	(break_with_forced_adjustment_request): ...to this.
	(init_env_requests): Update wire-uppery.

2025-12-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp: Refactor.  More cleanly separate input
	processing logic from engine logic.
	(do_break_request): Rename this...
	(break_output_line): ...to this.  Mark it `static` since it does
	not require external linkage.  Drop its manipulation of the
	input stream via the global `tok` object...
	(break_without_adjustment, break_without_adjustment): ...in
	favor of simply calling `skip_line()` from these handlers for
	the `br` and `brp` requests, which take no arguments.

2025-12-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Add new Boolean-valued parameter to
	`read_input_until_terminator()`, `want_identifier`, defaulting
	to false, so that we can distinguish callers that want a GNU
	troff identifier from those gathering some other kind of input.
	This is so that can we can reject (all) C0 control and Latin-1
	Supplement characters in identifiers.  (C1 controls are already
	rejected on input.)  The prohibition against C0 controls is to
	make the language less tolerant of unreadable input, and the
	latter is to enable us to pivot to reading UTF-8-encoded input
	in a future release.
	(read_input_until_terminator): Update declaration to add new
	parameter with default value.  Update definition to reject, with
	error diagnostic, character codes less than 32 and greater than
	159.  Add assertion that the putative identifier character is
	not a space (character code 32); these have never been valid in
	*roff identifiers.  This function's callers must ensure that the
	terminator precedes any space in the input.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67734>.

2025-12-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_delimited_measurement): Make
	function definition agree with declaration; return object of
	type `units` rather than `int`.  (They're type-aliased with
	`typedef`, but scrupulous type correctness is more conceptually
	coherent and forecloses an avenue of future error.)

2025-12-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_input_until_terminator):
	Slightly refactor.  Introduce `const`-qualified local variable
	to defeat inadvertent lvalue assignment.

2025-12-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_input_until_terminator):
	Trivially refactor.  Split assignment-within-comparison into its
	own statement.  Arrange equality comparisons to (prepare to)
	avoid inadvertent lvalue assignment.

2025-12-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_define_string, define_string)
	(define_nocomp_string, append_string, append_nocomp_macro)
	(do_define_macro, define_macro, define_nocomp_string)
	(define_indirect_macro, define_indirect_nocomp_macro)
	(append_macro, append_nocomp_macro, append_indirect_macro)
	(append_indirect_nocomp_macro): Fix code style nit.  Mark
	functions `static` since they do not require external linkage.

2025-12-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_define_macro): Work on Savannah
	#67735.  Assign `char`-valued literals to temporary `int`
	storing value we got from `read_char_in_copy_mode()` (which
	calls `input_iterator::fill()`, which in turn calls getc(3)),
	since it is destined to become an input character--if we don't
	have to handle EOF.  Since we must, drop C-style type casts to
	`unsigned char` while still scanning input.  Absence of a
	premature EOF established, use `static_cast` operator to demote
	this `int` to `unsigned char` before appending it to a macro.

2025-12-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_define_macro): Improve
	diagnostic.  Communicate error to the user by _describing what
	happened_, rather than just throwing a noun phrase at them.

2025-12-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_define_macro): Slightly refactor.
	Parallelize wording of error diagnostic when encountering EOF
	inside `ig`nored input, pull it into a local `static const`
	character array, and pass that to our diagnostic functions.

2025-12-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Trivially refactor.
	(read_char_in_copy_mode, do_define_macro): Parenthesize formally
	complex expressions.

2025-12-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Trivially refactor.  Rename
	`get_copy()` to `read_char_in_copy_mode()`, because this
	function advances the input stream pointer and because it
	changes the formatter's lexing and parsing rules from the
	default to "copy mode", a fundamental *roff concept since J. F.
	Ossanna transformed roff(1) into the macro language nroff(1)
	with the introduction of macro definitions circa 1972.
	(get_copy): Rename this...
	(read_char_in_copy_mode): ...to this (decl and defn).
	(read_char_in_copy_mode): Rename Boolean-valued argument
	`handle_escape_E` to `handle_escaped_E`, to appease the ruthless
	grammarian in my head.
	(read_char_in_escape_sequence_parameter)
	(has_arg)
	(process_input_stack)
	(decode_macro_call_arguments)

	(tag)
	(taga)

	(read_rest_of_line_as_argument): Update call sites.

2025-12-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (get_number_rigidly): Delete.  It no
	longer has a caller; that has migrated to `read_measurement(...,
	..., true)`.  Continues commit 6dcbaa0a7a, 19 December.

2025-12-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (glyph_node::add_self): Initialize
	local pointer variable `nn` to `0`.  Before returning,
	`assert(3)` that it is no longer a null pointer.

2025-12-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::is_usable_as_delimiter)
	(token::description): Double the size of the stack-allocated
	buffer we use to populate diagnostic messages about characters
	being unsuitable for use as delimiter, or unsuitable for use at
	all, respectively.  I'm thrilled about neither potentially
	truncating identifiers nor about grabbing a potentially
	unbounded amount of space from the stack, nor about leaking
	memory on the heap--there's no good place to free this memory
	because we return a `char` pointer to our caller.  Risking
	truncation seems the best of a bad set of choices.

2025-12-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description): Improve
	diagnostic when describing a nonexistent special character or
	class by reporting its identifier, at least up to the point
	where the size of our buffer truncates it.  (How do you get a
	"nonexistent special character or class" that nevertheless has
	an identifier?  It's part of the input syntax.  What you do is
	attempt to interpolate a special character [or class--an invalid
	operation anyway, but stay with me] in a context where character
	interpolation makes no sense, as in a numeric expression.)

2025-12-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/preconv/preconv.cpp (do_file): Say "non-portable"
	instead of "unportable" in diagnostic message.  Prompted by a
	similar change to the tzdata project by Paul Eggert.

2025-12-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/groff.texi.in (Delimiters):
	* man/groff.7.man (Delimiters): Clarify that an invalid escape
	sequence is valid as a delimiter if the character after the
	escape character would be valid as one.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67375>.

2025-12-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/groff.texi.in (Delimiters):
	* man/groff.7.man (Delimiters): Clarify what makes an escape
	sequence ineligible for use as a delimiter--not its
	parameterization, but its own use of delimiters.  Relatedly,
	document the clever hack (dirty trick?) GNU eqn and tbl use to
	surround arbitrary user input with delimiters that are nigh upon
	guaranteed not to collide with that input.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67372>.  I hope.

2025-12-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Split `TOKEN_SPECIAL_CHAR` token type into two, leaving
	the existing one for `\(` and `\[` escape sequences, and
	creating a new `TOKEN_DELIMITED_SPECIAL_CHAR` for the delimited
	`\C` escape sequence.

	* src/roff/troff/token.h (class token): Add new

	(token::is_special_character, token::is_any_character): Return
	`true` for both new and old token types.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::next) <C>: Tokenize `C`

	to date back to groff's birth.

2025-12-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/tests/check-delimiter-validity.sh: Add

2025-12-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description): Drop

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.

	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (page_offset, page_length): Rename

	(init_div_requests): Update wire-uppery.

2025-12-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Refactor.  Move page offset access from language
	parser logic into "engine" logic.

	* src/roff/troff/div.h: Drop unnecessary declaration of
	`page_offset()` returning `void`.  This concealed a latent
	symbol visibility problem.
	(class top_level_diversion): Declare new member function
	`get_previous_page_offset()`, giving it a simple inline
	definition akin to the existing `get_page_offset()`.
	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (page_offset): Make request handler
	use accessor member functions instead of retrieving the
	diversion's properties directly.

2025-12-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Refactor.  Move page offset updates from language
	parser logic into "engine" logic.

	* src/roff/troff/div.h (class top_level_diversion): Declare new
	member function `set_page_offset()`.
	(top_level_diversion::set_page_offset): Define it, and make it
	responsible for updating both `page_offset` and
	`prev_page_offset` private member variables.
	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (page_offset): Make request handler
	call this new mutator member function instead of manipulating
	the diversion's properties directly.

	[grohtml,grotty]: Fix Savannah #67843.

	* tmac/html-end.tmac:
	* tmac/tty.tmac: Set the page offset to zero _twice_, to better
	simulate AT&T nroff behavior.  (Do it for the "html" device too;
	it better resembles an nroff-mode device than a troff-mode one.)

2025-12-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Refactor.  Split `TOKEN_HORIZONTAL_MOTION` token type
	into two, leaving the existing one for `\0`, `\^`, and `\|`
	escape sequences, and creating a new
	`TOKEN_DELIMITED_HORIZONTAL_MOTION` for the parameterized `\h`
	escape sequence.

	* src/roff/troff/token.h (class token): Add new
	`TOKEN_DELIMITED_HORIZONTAL_MOTION` enumeration constant.
	(token::is_horizontal_motion): Return `true` for both new and
	old token types.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::next) <h>: Tokenize `h`
	escape sequence as `TOKEN_DELIMITED_HORIZONTAL_MOTION`.
	(token::is_usable_as_delimiter): Reject
	`TOKEN_DELIMITED_HORIZONTAL_MOTION` instead of
	`TOKEN_HORIZONTAL_MOTION` as a delimiter.
	(token::next <z>, process_input_stack)
	(token::add_to_zero_width_node_list, token::process): Treat new
	token type the same as the old one.
	(token::description): Describe new token type distinctly.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/check-delimiter-validity.sh: Delete check
	for invalidity of `\0`, `\^`, and `\|` as delimiters--they're
	valid again now.

	* doc/groff.texi.in (Delimiters):
	* man/groff.7.man (Delimiters): Re-document `\0`, `\^`, and `\|`
	as valid delimiters.

2025-12-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/token.h (class token): Trivially refactor.
	Sort enumeration constants lexicographically by their symbol
	names.  It seems that they once were thus sorted (except for
	`TOKEN_EOF`), but my renaming activities have effaced that.
	Restore that ordering, but stop treating `TOKEN_EOF` specially.
	Its magnitude is never compared to anything (and shouldn't be).

2025-12-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_title_parts): Throw deprecation
	warning in category "delim" if the delimiter is invalid and
	we're not in compatibility mode.  This is a training wheel to
	get people off of ambiguous delimiters.  See Savannah #66009.

2025-12-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/tests/check-delimiter-validity.sh: Improve
	tests.  Clarify progress messages to distinguish escape
	sequence, title request, and output comparison contexts.  Test
	two characters ('@', '_') that weren't tested before because I
	ran out of steam.  Test delimiters used with title requests and
	output comparisons even when not in compatibility mode.  Also
	cosmetically sort big lists to vertically align punctuation
	characters that aren't significant in numeric expressions,
	pairing them up by low-order bits of their ISO 646 code points.

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.  Rename `get_long_name()` to
	`read_long_identifier()`, because it's used for more than just
	reading "names" (request, macro, string, or diversion
	identifiers), but also identifiers of environments, colors,
	registers, typefaces (fonts, famililies, and styles), and file
	names.  (The last occurs only in `ps_bbox_request()` and might
	be inapposite; GNU troff now handles file names with spaces in
	them, and that might not work because the `psbb` request is not
	parsing its arguments appropriately.)
	* src/roff/troff/token.h: Rename in declaration.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (get_long_name): Rename this...
	(read_long_identifier): ...to this.
	* src/roff/troff/column.cpp (column_justify) [COLUMN]:

	sites.

2025-12-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/token.h: Relocate declaration of "input.cpp"
	function `has_arg()` to sit alongside others for the same file,
	and mark it `extern`.  Arrange nearby declarations to match the
	order of their definition in "input.cpp", in case any deep
	meaning is thereby revealed (perhaps not).

2025-12-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor for conceptual clarity.  In *roff,
	spaces and horizontal motions are distinct kinds of thing.
	Spaces are potentially breakable, discardable (at the distal
	ends of text lines), and adjustable.  Horizontal motions are
	none of these.

	* src/roff/troff/token.h (class token): Rename enumeration
	constant from `TOKEN_HORIZONTAL_SPACE` to
	`TOKEN_HORIZONTAL_MOTION`.  Rename member function declaration
	from `is_horizontal_space()` to `is_horizontal_motion()`.
	(token::is_horizontal_space): Rename this...

	* src/roff/troff/token.h (class token): Rename member function
	{declared} from `is_white_space()` to

	chromatic sense (cf. "red" or "black") but in an abstract one;
	further, this member function does not test for form feeds or
	any other conceivable "vertical whitespace".
	(token::is_white_space): Rename {definition} from this...
	(token::is_horizontal_whitespace): ...to this.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (process_input_stack): Update lone
	call site.  (So why have `is_horizontal_whitespace()` in the
	`token` class at all?)

	[troff]: Refactor to use the force--C++ default argument force.
	Merge function `get_number_rigidly()` into `read_measurement(),
	which differed by one line out of a dozen, by extending the
	latter's signature with a default argument `is_mandatory` of
	type `bool`.  This coincidentally made GCC's overload resolver
	more sensitive to arguments of ambiguous integral type, so take
	this opportunity to stop punning between character literals and
	`unsigned char`, in favor of the explicitness we'll need anyway
	for GNU troff's planned wider fundamental character type.

	* src/roff/troff/token.h: Drop declaration of
	`get_number_rigidly()`.  Update declaration of
	`read_measurement()` with `bool`-valued 3rd argument defaulting
	`false`.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_color_channel_value)
	(do_expr_test, read_size, do_register)
	(is_conditional_expression_true, evaluate_expression):

	Explicitly construct literal of `unsigned char` type as argument
	to `read_measurement()`.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_expr_test): Migrate only call
	site of `get_number_rigidly()` to `read_measurement()` with an
	explicit `true` 3rd argument.
	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (get_number_rigidly): Delete.
	(read_measurement): Accept third argument, `is_mandatory`, of
	type `bool`.  Pass it to `is_valid_expression()`, which is
	already prepared for same.

2025-12-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp: Fix code style nits.  Replace
	preprocessor macro `SCALING_UNITS` with `static const char`
	array `valid_scaling_units`.
	(is_valid_term): Use the array instead of the string literal
	macro as the haystack in strchr(3) call; explicitly construct a
	`char`-typed needle from an `int`-typed argument.
	(is_valid_term, scale): Parenthesize formally complex
	expressions.
	(scale): Split one `&&`-using assert(3)ion into two.  Construct
	temporary `unsigned int` objects using the syntax C++ seems to
	support for this.  Return object of type `units` rather than
	`int`.  (They're type-aliased with `typedef`, but scrupulous
	type correctness is more conceptually coherent and forecloses an
	avenue of future error.)
	(is_valid_expression, is_valid_term): Prepare (I think) all
	comparisons of C++ character literals to the input read by our
	numeric expression parser for groff's planned wider fundamental
	character type.  Construct `int`s from character literals, and
	annotate their need to be constructed as that future type.

	* tmac/ps.tmac: Delete internal macros after we're done using
	them.  They are not documented and therefore not supported for
	use by documents.  They consequently should not litter the macro

	* src/roff/groff/groff.cpp (main): Initialize `want_unsafe_mode`
	to `false`, not `true`.  When flipping the semantics of this
	variable name in commit 3a1b01474d (to make it easier to
	implement "locking" `-S` option behavior), I neglected to flip
	its default value.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67815>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the report and root-cause analysis.  Problem
	introduced by me in commit 3a1b01474d, 7 October.

	instead of "README.git" as the indicator of a Git checkout.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67787>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the report.

2025-12-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl: Improve heuristics for distinguishing
	mm(7) documents from those for other packages.
	(interpret_line): Recognize `APP`, `APPSK`, `AF`, `AS`,
	`COVEND`, `INITI`, `IND`, `INDP`, `INITR`, `SETR`, `GETHN`,
	`GETPN`, `ISODATE`, `MULB`, `MULN`, and `MULE` as unique to mm.
	(infer_man_or_ms_package): Stop recognizing `RP`, `TL`, `AU`,
	`ND`, `AE`, `B1`, `B2`, `DS`, `DE`, `1C`, `2C`, and `MC` as
	unique to ms, since mm also defines them.  Stop recognizing `P`
	and `EX` as unique to man, since mm also defines them.
	* src/utils/grog/tests/smoke-test.sh: Add most mm examples as
	test cases.  A couple are deeply ambiguous, like "B1B2", which
	is so limited that it is valid (and renders sensibly) with
	either the mm(7) _or_ ms(7) packages, and "story.mm" which uses
	only macro names that are shared variously among man(7), mm(7),
	mom(7), and ms(7).

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67802>.

2025-12-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/xtotroff/xtotroff.c (MapFont): Make fatal error
	diagnostic on memory allocation failure disclose how many bytes
	we attempted to grab from the heap.  This way the user can
	better distinguish system starvation scenarios from attempted
	denial-of-service attacks (or worse).  (Admittedly, few people
	ever run xtotroff at all, let alone in scenarios where a busy
	system is so pinned that `malloc(PATH_MAX)` is likely to fail.
	But I feel that since we have this information, we should
	disclose it.)

2025-12-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_input_until_terminator): Fix
	apparent memory leak.  The heap-allocated memory we allocate to
	back the local `buf` was not being freed on an error path out of
	the function.

2025-12-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Trivially refactor.  Rename
	`do_get_long_name()` to `read_input_until_terminator()` because
	{A} that's more descriptive of its function, and {B} it's used
	for more than just reading "long names" (GNU troff-style
	identifiers); in fact 4 out of its 5 call sites read things that
	aren't identifiers.
	(do_get_long_name): Rename declaration and definition from
	this...
	(read_input_until_terminator): ...to this.
	(read_rgb, read_cmy, read_cmyk, read_gray, do_get_long_name):
	Update call sites.

2025-12-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Migrate more input character reading
	functions to deal in the type `unsigned char` rather than
	`char`.
	(do_get_long_name): Update declaration.
	(read_rgb, read_cmy, read_cmyk, read_gray, do_get_long_name):
	Update definitions.
	(get_long_name): Update `do_get_long_name()` call site to use
	literal of `unsigned char` rathern than `char` type.
	(do_get_long_name): Change type of local variable `buf` from
	`char` to `unsigned char`, since it is directly populated by
	reads of bytes from the input stream.  This function converts
	said input into an object of the groff class `symbol` and
	returns it, but `symbol` has no constructor accepting a pointer
	to `const unsigned char`.  Consequently, once we have
	successfuly populated `buf`, create a new buffer `chbuf`, a
	heap-allocated array of `char` type.  Free this array after
	constructing a `symbol` on the stack.  (If all this seems like
	rigmarole, consider that it's going to be necessary anyway when
	we read bytes from the input stream, confirm that they're valid
	UTF-8 sequences, apply Normalization Form D decomposition, and
	then store them as one or more 32-bit code points in GNU troff's
	planned future internal character data type.  See Savannah
	#40720.)
	(read_drawing_command_color_arguments): Change type of `end`
	local variable from `int` to `unsigned char`, since that is what
	the `read_{rgb,cmy,cmyk,gray}()` functions now expect as
	arguments.

	Continues the long process of fixing Savannah #67735.

2025-12-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_identifier): Fix code style

	integer, literals.

2025-12-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_delimited_identifier): Update

2025-12-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Trivially refactor.  Rename
	`read_delimited_name()` to `read_delimited_identifier()`.  This
	function isn't actually used for "names" (identifiers of macros,
	strings, and diversions), but, at present, only for special
	character or class identifiers.  But its operation is
	sufficiently general to handle any GNU troff identifier.

2025-12-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (charinfo::dump): Use more

	Fix it by moving the condition that terminates the input reading

2025-12-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Describe character (classes) better.  Character classes
	have one more property beyond their name, and lists of ranges
	and nested classes: a set of character flags that the formatter
	bitwise "or"s with any character members of the class
	{recursively}.  However, the computation of flags applicable to
	a character has been done lazily almost from the time the
	character class feature was first implemented, presumably to
	keep a `cflags` request on a highly populated character class
	from taking a lot of time.  Improve the output of `pchar`
	accordingly.  When reporting properties of a character class,
	report the flags associated with it.  When reporting properties
	of a character, if it is a member of any class, compute its
	"effective" character flags and report them in distinction to
	its "inherent" character flags if they differ.  Then, revert the
	lazy computation of the effective character flags so that the
	`pchar` request has no visible effect on formatter state; we
	want this property for debugging documents, avoiding Heisenbugs.

	* roff/troff/charinfo.h (class charinfo): Declare new
	`describe_flags()` member function returning `void`.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (charinfo::describe_flags): Refactor
	the tedious flags-to-English logic from `charinfo::dump_flags()`
	into this new member function, since we might need to perform
	this translation more than once when dumping a character's
	properties.
	(charinfo::describe_flags): Strip out flags-to-English
	translation as above.  For a character per se (not a class),
	report assigned character flags thereto as "inherent".  Then
	save them, do the lazy computation that normally occurs when
	formatting a character, report the combination as the "effective
	flags" if they differ, and restore the saved flags.
	(charinfo::dump): Call `dump_flags()` on character classes.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67711>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for prompting me to better understand this aspect of GNU
	troff's design.

	standard error stream) into its own member function of the
	`charinfo` class because (A) it's about 50 lines of code and (B)
	we're about to need another call site, and there's no way
	repeating 50 lines of code is a good idea.

	* src/roff/troff/charinfo.h (class charinfo): Declare new
	`dump_flags()` member function returning `void`.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (charinfo::dump_flags): Implement it,
	moving code to here...
	(charinfo::dump): ...from here, instead calling the new
	function.

2025-12-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description): Describe a
	`TOKEN_NODE` explicitly as a "token", because it still is one.

2025-12-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description): Return the node
	token description using the correct buffer.

2025-12-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description): Hedge against
	programmer carelessness.  If someone creates a node type without
	a human-readable descripion, pre-populate the buffer describing
	it with a revealing description that is less frustrating than
	nothing at all.

2025-12-01  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/xditview/xditview.am
	(src/devices/xditview/GXditview-ad.h): Add `$(MKDIR_P)` to
	target rule to ensure the parent directory exists.  This problem
	is hard to observe because it shows up only when our `configure`
	script is run with the `--disable-dependency-tracking` option
	and, apparently, stochastically with highly parallelized builds.
	{A "stock" build never encounters it because with
	"dependency tracking", Automake generates make(1) files that
	create ".deps" files in the build tree, and a prerequisite to
	doing so is to create the parents of the directories housing
	them, a convenience that this target rule snuck through.}

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67754> and
	<https://bugs.debian.org/1121570>.  Problem dates back at least
	to commit 62a22cb540, 22 August 2014 (but which did not appear
	in the "master" branch until 27 January of the next year), when
	groff's build system adopted Automake.  Thanks to Helmut Grohne
	for the report and Colin Watson for assistance reproducing it.

2025-12-01  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (charinfo::get_flags): Fix
	inadvertent regression caused by fumbled refactoring, wherein I
	inexplicably mistook a Boolean-valued return type for an
	`int`-valued one.  (`contains()` sounds Boolean to me now, in
	the cold light of day.)

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67570>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the report.  Problem introduced by me in commit
	77d8f728d, 4 September.

2025-11-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (is_valid_expression_start):
	Slightly refactor.  Call `tok.skip_spaces()` instead of
	open-coding exactly what it does.

2025-11-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/div.h: Drop unnecessary declaration of
	`begin_page()`.

2025-11-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Trivially refactor.  Rename function
	`read_delimited_number()` to `read_delimited_measurement()` to
	reinforce the fact that it reads a measurement (which is, in
	turn, a numeric expression potentially including operators).
	(read_delimited_number): Rename (overloaded) declarations and
	definitions from these...
	(read_delimited_measurement): ...to these.
	(token::next): Update call sites.

	inadvertent lvalue assignment.

2025-11-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (is_valid_term): Adjust wording of
	warnings in "syntax" category.

2025-11-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (warnscale_request): Fix code style
	nit.  Favor value constructors over C-style type casts.  Arrange
	equality comparisons to avoid inadvertent lvalue assignment.

2025-11-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (warnscale_request): In warning
	diagnostic in category "syntax", accurately describe the
	argument to the request even if it is something bizarre, instead
	of presenting the user with an empty pair of quotation marks.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67747>.  Problem dates
	back to intoduction of `warnscale` request in commit 9993a881c1,
	5 May 2002.

2025-11-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (warnscale_request): Actually reset
	the computed `warn_scale` to `units_per_inch` when recovering
	from an invalid argument and telling the user we're reverting to
	inches.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67748>.  Problem dates
	back to intoduction of `warnscale` request in commit 9993a881c1,
	5 May 2002.

2025-11-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp: Explicitly construct the global
	constant `TAB_REPEAT_CHAR` as type `unsigned char`, because it
	is destined for comparison to input characters, instead of
	inheriting the type `char` from its literal initializer.

	Continues the long process of fixing Savannah #67735.

2025-11-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Fix regression in syntax warning diagnostics introduced
	in recent days' commits.  Now that we're scrupulous about the
	data type of an input character to GNU troff, our diagnostic
	apparatus takes us at our word when we pass it unsigned chars,
	and it formats them as decimal integers instead of characters.
	Use value constructors to pass C++ `char`s where appropriate.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (is_conditional_expression_true):
	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (is_valid_term): Do it.

2025-11-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_size): Clarify diagnostic when
	an `\s` escape sequence that is bracketed or delimited (a GNU
	extension) contains an invalid numeric expression.  Describe
	what we were expecting and what we got instead.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67746>.  Problem
	observable since groff 1.22.3 and appears to date back to
	groff's birth.

2025-11-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Perform more careful comparisons of the `unsigned char`
	values the formatter reads from input (or a token sequence) by
	promoting either the token or a character literal to which it is
	compared to `int` to (A) explicitly avoid issues with the
	implementation-defined signedness of unqualified `char`, and (B)
	lay foundation for future migration of GNU troff's internal
	character type to a custom, wider type.

	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (return_request):
	* src/roff/troff/reg.cpp (assign_register_format_request):

	(read_drawing_command):
	Store return value of `tok.ch()` in local variable of `int`, not
	`char`, type.
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp: Retype global `TAB_REPEAT_CHAR` from
	{`const`} `char` to `unsigned char`.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_size): Use local variables to
	avoid repeated member function calls.  (Presumably a smart
	optimizer would do the equivalent on its own, but this change
	also makes a lengthy compound conditional expression shorter.)

	Begins a long long process of fixing Savannah #67735.

2025-11-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_size): Fix code style nit;
	compare integer-valued variable to integer literal instead of
	letting it pun down to a Boolean.

2025-11-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_get_long_name, read_size):

	code style nit; parenthesize formally complex expressions.

2025-11-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_name_test, return_macro_request):
	Fix code style nits.  Rather than letting an input character pun
	down to a Boolean value, compare it to an appropriate constant
	literal.

2025-11-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_identifier, do_get_long_name)
	(get_delimited_name): Fix code style nits.  Compare input
	character values to constant literals of appropriate type and
	signedness--they should be `unsigned char`s, since the formatter
	reads its input as bytes.

2025-11-24  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.  Rename `token` class's member
	function `is_character()` to `is_any_character()` to try and get
	across the idea that it's true for _any_ sort of character:
	ordinary {`A`}, special {`\[em]`, `\C'em'`}, or indexed
	{`\N'45'`}.

	* src/roff/troff/token.h (class token): Update declaration.
	(token::is_any_character): Update (inline) definition.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (print_character_request)
	(remove_character):

	(assign_register_format_request, remove_register_request)
	(alias_register_request, rename_register_request)
	(print_register_request): Mark functions `static` since they do
	not require external linkage.

2025-11-24  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (are_comparands_equal): Fix code
	style nit; parenthesize formally complex expression.

2025-11-24  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_request): Adjust wording of
	warning diagnostic to better describe what the `do` request
	actually does.

2025-11-24  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_overstrike, do_bracket)
	(token::next): Convert some recent assertions to error
	diagnostics, since inputs to provoke them are not impossible.
	I found these by attempting to format GNU troff's own ELF
	executable as a document (the laziest possible fuzz testing).

2025-11-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description): Add description
	of the "empty" token type to which the global `tok` is
	initialized.  This comes up in a corner case of parser state,
	because sometimes we have to read multiple characters to decide
	what kind of token the very first one in the input stream is.
	Consider a delimited escape sequence whose wheels fall off
	because it's invalidly delimited.

2025-11-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_delimited_number)
	(read_delimited_name): Refactor.  Make logic more parallel.
	Make both functions check explicitly for EOF where the starting
	delimiter should be (and throw error if it's encountered).  Make
	both call `is_usable_as_delimiter()` member function of
	`start_token` object.  Parallelize wording of warning
	diagnostics in "delim" category.

2025-11-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/tests/check-delimiter-validity.sh: Add unit
	test for foregoing change to delimiters accepted when reading a
	delimited name.

2025-11-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_delimited_name): Stop accepting
	horizontal motion tokens as escape sequence delimiters.  This is
	to prohibit use of the delimited `\h` escape sequence as a
	delimiter, but because of GNU troff's internal design, also
	prohibits the parameterless `\0`, `\^`, and `\|` delimiters.

	* doc/groff.texi.in (Delimiters):
	* man/groff.7.man (Delimiters): De-document support for these
	delimiters.

	* NEWS: Report change.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67744>.  The problem of
	acceptance of `\h` as an escape sequence delimiter appears to
	date back to groff's birth.  (`get_delim_name()` didn't check
	for any token types except EOF and newline.)

2025-11-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

2025-11-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description): Add assertion;
	every token type should have a human-readable description.  In
	the event that's not the case and `NDEBUG` is defined, describe
	the anomalous token as "an undescribed token" rather than "a
	magic token", to make it clearer that the problem results from
	developer oversight.

2025-11-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/token.h: Add new inline member function
	`is_node()` to aid input parser diagnostics.

2025-11-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Trivially refactor.  Rename
	`get_delimited_name()` to `read_delimited_name()` because it
	does not retrieve a property; it advances the input stream
	pointer.  Update declaration and definition.
	(token::next): Update call site.

2025-11-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::is_usable_as_delimiter): Use

2025-11-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Refactor new token description logic into its own
	function, since there is a second place it can be used.

	* src/roff/troff/token.h (class token): Declare new
	`describe_node()` member function.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description): Move the logic
	from here...

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (assign_control_character)
	(assign_no_break_control_character): Fix blunders in `assert()`

	That can't be achieved if we wrap substantive function calls (or
	expressions with side effects) with `assert()`.

	Continues commit e09bc6c083, 7 May 2023 (but not merged onto the

2025-11-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::add_node): Add assertion.
	This function should never be given a null pointer argument.

2025-11-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::make_tag): When not
	formatting HTML, return a new transparent dummy node instead of
	a null pointer.  When this function was implemented in
	2001-2004, the decision to return a null pointer violated an
	{undocumented, possibly uncontemplated} invariant that
	`environment::add_node()` was never passed a null pointer.  By
	returning an actual object, we can restore that invariant.

2025-11-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp: Fix code style nits.
	(environment::make_tab_node): Parenthesize formally complex

	(environment::make_tab_node, environment::advance_to_tab_stop):
	Explicitly compare value of pointer type to null pointer literal
	instead of letting it pun down to a Boolean.  Revise logic for
	less cleverness (gratuitous use of ternary operator on pointer).

2025-11-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	braino in assertion message.

2025-11-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (remove_font_specific_character):
	Recover from invalid input more robustly.  If we encounter an
	invalid character token in the `rfschar` argument list (one that
	has a null pointer to its `charinfo`), and the build used
	`NDEBUG` to suppress assertions, skip the character and process
	the next token (if any) instead of ignoring the rest of the
	input line.  Also proceed to the next token if the font-specific
	character to be removed already doesn't exist as such.
	`rfschar` now better aligns with what `cflags` and `rchar` do.

	it from execution with an early `return`.  Add assertion for
	impossible situation of a special character already being
	defined with a null groff `symbol` as its identifier.  For
	`NDEBUG` builds, return early should that eventuate, as we can't
	usefully call `map_special_character_for_device_output()` with a
	null pointer argument.

2025-11-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (remove_font_specific_character): Add
	null pointer check on `charinfo` object returned by
	`get_charinfo()` on token (a character to be removed as a
	font-specific fallback, which need not already exist).  If null,
	break from the loop just as is already done when the lookup on
	the same character as a font-specific character takes place.
	{Font-specific fallback characters are implemented sneakily by
	injecting spaces into their identifiers, making them otherwise
	invalid.  Where `A`, `\[em]` or `\N'45'` are non-font-specific
	characters (be they fallbacks or not), `TR \[em]` is a fallback
	for `\[em]` specific to the font named `TR`.}

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp
	(encode_special_character_for_device_output): Simplify logic.
	Both branches in this function were doing the same thing, except
	for a null pointer check.  Add another null pointer check since,
	in theory, `charinfo::get_symbol()` can return one.  Continues
	commit c4259eb20a, 14 September 2024.

	describes indexed characters adequately.

2025-11-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (add_hyphenation_exceptions): Fix code
	style nit; parenthesize formally complex expressions.  Also
	break lengthy chain of short-circuit operators across multiple
	lines, using indentation to illuminate (lack of) nesting.

2025-11-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Slightly refactor.  Make the global function
	`check_missing_character()` a member function of the `token`
	class since it operates only on token objects and can be more
	economically expressed that way.  Rename it.

	* src/roff/troff/token.h: Drop `extern` declaration of global
	`check_missing_character()`.
	(class token): Declare new member function.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (check_missing_character): Relocate
	from here...

	our documentation.

2025-11-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (add_hyphenation_exceptions): Drop
	`error()` call prior to `assert()`.  It's okay if, when built
	with the preprocessor `NDEBUG` symbol defined, we silently
	discard the remainder of the input line and resume reading the
	next.  Should feel familiar to users of AT&T troff.  (Also, this
	makes a forthcoming change easier.)

2025-11-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (margin_character): Trivially refactor.
	Invert test and resequence logic to handle the argumentless form
	of the `mc` request first.  This is to facilitate a forthcoming
	change.

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.  Rename `skip()` member function of
	`token` class to `skip_spaces()` so that it is obvious at all of

	stream.

	* src/roff/troff/token.h (class token): Rename declaration.

2025-11-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description): Slightly
	refactor.  Use different technique (with `static` `const`

	special character or character class token.  See
	`assign_escape_character()` for a similar pattern.

2025-11-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.  Rename `get_char()` member

	Update call sites.

2025-11-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.  Rename `get_charinfo()` global
	function to `lookup_charinfo()` because (a) this parallels the
	naming of other functions that look up (and potentially create)
	entries in dictionaries (cf. `lookup_{color,family,request,
	warning}()`), and (b) this function is not an accessor
	{"getter"} for a property of a class object.

	* src/roff/troff/charinfo.h (get_charinfo): Rename declaration
	from this...
	(lookup_charinfo): ...to this.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (get_charinfo): Rename definition

2025-11-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (define_class_request): Stop adding
	the second end point of a character code range (to a character
	class) duplicatively as a singleton, preventing redundant
	population of the range.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67718>.

2025-11-18  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (define_class_request): Eliminate
	extraneous diagnostic message.  We already throw a more
	contextually specific one subsequently.

2025-11-18  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::get_char): Recognize
	existence of indexed characters in diagnostic messages.

2025-11-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/groff.texi.in (Manipulating Hyphenation):
	* man/groff.7.man (Request short reference): Fix error that
	crept into groff 1.23.0 documentation; hyphenation exception
	words have no association with formatter environments (though
	that is a contemplated change; see Savannah #66387).

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66803>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the report.  Problem introduced by me in commit
	493a01c02d4, 28 June 2020.

2025-11-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (Warn): Set exit status to 1, not
	2, if the scalar `warnexit` (set by the `-W` command-line
	option) is truthy.
	(usage): Exit with status 2, not 1, on usage errors.
	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.1.man (Options, Exit status): Update
	documentation accordingly.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67612>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the report and to him and Deri for the code review.

2025-11-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Slightly refactor.
	(assign_escape_character, interpolate_arg): Mark variables
	pointing to C string literals as `static` and `const`.
	(assign_escape_character): Mark variable that selects between
	one of the aforementioned static literals a pointer to `const`.

2025-11-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (get_line_arg): Trivially refactor.
	Rename function argument whose type is a pointer to a `charinfo`
	object from `cp` to `cip` for (slightly more) clarity.  `ci` is
	almost universally used in the code base for `charinfo` objects.

2025-11-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_suppress): Improve diagnostic
	message when input malformed; the one we had wasn't clear in the
	easily anticipated scenario where the user assumes that `\O` is
	a delimited escape sequence (it isn't) and selects "'" as the
	"delimiter".

2025-11-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.  Rename `get_integer()` to
	`read_integer()` because it does more than retrieve a property;

2025-11-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Slightly refactor; boolify `charinfo` member functions.

	* src/roff/troff/charinfo.h (class charinfo): Demote integer
	arguments to `set_translation()` and `set_special_translation()`
	from `int` to `bool`.
	(charinfo::get_special_translation): Rename argument from
	`for_transparent_throughput` to `transparently`.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (charinfo::set_translation): Demote
	argument types as above, and rename from the cryptic `tt` and
	`ti` to `transparently` and `as_input`, respectively.
	(charinfo::set_special_translation): Demote argument types as
	above.  Rename `c` to `cc` ("character code", as abbreviated
	elsewhere in this file), and `tt` to `transparently`.
	(do_translate): Demote integer arguments `translate_transparent`
	and `translate_input` from `int` to `bool`, and rename them to
	`transparently` and `as_input`, respectively, to obviously
	correspond with `charinfo` class member functions to which they
	are passed.
	(transparent_translate, translate, translate_no_transparent)
	(transparent_input): Update call sites to use Boolean literals
	and annotate argument correspondence.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (charinfo::set_hyphenation_code): Fix

	so doing, parenthesize formally complex expression.

2025-11-18  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.  Rename `get_name()` to
	`read_identifier()`.  Part of the idea here is to use the verb
	"read" to suggest that the function advances the token pointer
	through the input stream (and it does).  Another part is to
	reduce confusion, since the `font_info` and `tfont` classes have
	an unrelated accessor member function `get_name()`.

	* src/roff/troff/token.h (get_name): Rename declaration from

	buffer sizes (for C strings), and in so doing express the
	maximal expected output to that buffer.

2025-11-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description): Describe
	character class objects distinctly from special characters.
	(print_character_request): Update error diagnostic to recognize
	that a character class is also worthy argument fodder to the
	`pchar` request.
	(charinfo::dump): Report totally different information for a
	character class.  Call the `dump()` member function of the its
	associated (empty) macro from the previous change.  This way the
	user troubleshooting character classes (or character
	class/special character collisions) can simply _ask_ the
	formatter where a character class is defined.  Report the only
	properties a character class has: a list of (potentially
	singleton) code point ranges and a list of nested classes.

2025-11-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/request.h (class macro): Declare new member

	the character class `charinfo` objects created by the `class`
	request.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (define_class): Create a macro object

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp: Refactor numeric expression parser
	to simplify and heighten severity of diagnostics.  This isn't
	a behavior change; character sequences that were invalid as
	numeric expressions were ignored before and remain so.  But
	since we're aborting interpretation of an argument to a request
	or escape sequence, where in at least one case AT&T troff did
	not--it would read through spurious tab characters to reach a
	valid numeric expression afterward--an error seems more
	appropriate.
	(is_valid_expression_start): Drop special handling of tab and
	right-brace escape sequences.  These get handled anyway when the
	term at the start of the expression gets interpreted...
	(is_valid_term): ...thus.  Raise diagnostic severity from

	mode.  Say that the conditional expression operator is "not
	portable to AT&T troff", for parallel phrasing with the escape
	sequence warning added in commit 589a724eca, 2 November, and
	because a person authoring or formatting a document presumably
	knows whether they're using compatibility mode.  (If they don't
	know, they can find out with `.tm compatibility mode is \n(.C`.)
	Prompted by discussion with James Youngman.

	[troff]: Improve "asciification" of more special characters.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (glyph_node::asciify): Fix and clarify
	logic.  First, if a glyph has an "asciify code", use that.
	Then, if it has a nonzero "ASCII code", use that.  Next, if it
	has a Unicode mapping, write out an appropriate escape sequence
	using the default escape character.  (This source file has no
	insight into what a user's selected escape character is.)  Map
	code points U+0022, U+0027, U+002D, U+005C, U+005E, U+0060, and
	U+007E to predefined special character escape sequences (see
	groff_char(7)).  For all other Unicode code points, write out an
	escape sequence of the form `\[uYXXXX]`.  Finally, if none of
	the foreging mappings exist, throw an error diagnostic and dump
	the glyph's "charinfo", as if `pchar` were invoked on a
	corresponding GNU troff character.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/asciify-request-works.sh: Adjust test
	expectations.  Reset the escape character to the default before
	interpolating an "asciified" diversion; see above.  Surrender to
	a regression; the new logic doesn't know how to cope with the
	fallback character definition for the `fl` special character
	defined in "ps.tmac".  (Possibly, the PDF device should delete
	this fallback character.)

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (transparent_translate): Fix code

	AT&T troff does _not_ permit ^A, ^D, ^H, ^I, or ^L.  But this

	* src/roff/groff/groff.cpp (main): Drop ersatz '(C)' symbol from
	copyright notice.

	Software developers have long labored under the no-longer-
	correct misconception that omitting a copyright symbol from
	one's notice was a fatal defect that effectively placed the work
	in the public domain.  That stopped being true as of 1 March
	1989.[1]  Further, prior to guidance issued by the U.S.
	Copyright Office in the decades since, the use of "(C)" as a
	substitute for a copyright sign _may not have sufficed_ to
	prevent the copyright notice from being regarded as defective.
	The Copyright Office, then and now, prefers the abbreviation
	"copr." when © is typographically unavailable.[ibid.]  Nowadays,
	its advice is that "c" (note lowercase) is an "acceptable
	variant", that _may_ retain the efficacy of the copyright
	notice.  The word "copyright", spelled out in full, also
	suffices per that resource, and is already present in this
	notice.

	[troff]: Fix Savannah #67408.  As I've observed before in the
	groff 1.24 development cycle, the delimiter situation is a mess.
	AT&T troff actually has three different, context-dependent, sets
	of delimiters; getting too adventurous, though, leads to core
	dumps, as with `\D0l 1 20' or `.if %0%0% .tm true`.  Last
	November, I attempted to streamline groff's delimiter handling,
	but inadvertently broke compatibility mode.  I still think it's
	valuable for GNU troff users to be able to rely upon a single
	set of delimiters when not exercising AT&T compatibility mode,
	so change the formatter to handle four cases of delimiter
	context: "groff" (not in compatibility mode), AT&T string
	expressions (as used in `\o` or `\b` or the `tl` request), AT&T
	numeric expressions (`\s`, the first argument to `\l` or `\L`),
	and output comparison operators.

	* src/roff/troff/token.h: Introduce new `delimiter_context`
	enumerated type.
	(class token): Add parameter to `is_usable_as_delimiter()`
	member function, defaulting its value to
	`DELIMITER_GROFF_EXPRESSION` since we expect that to be the most
	common case.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (is_usable_as_delimiter): Implement
	the three special cases for AT&T troff compatibility.
	(do_overstrike)
	(do_bracket)
	(do_name_test)
	(do_expr_test)
	(do_zero_width_output)
	(get_line_arg)
	(read_size)
	(do_register)
	(do_width)
	(do_device_extension)
	(read_drawing_command)
	(read_delimited_number): Distinguish compatibility mode.  If in
	it and given invalid delimiter, throw warning in category
	"delim" and unwind the operation, behaving more like AT&T troff.
	{Outside of compatibility mode, GNU troff uses the delimiter
	anyway, but warns of its ambiguity.}
	(is_conditional_expression_true): Refactor, introducing new
	Boolean local variable `perform_output_comparison`.  Throw
	syntax warning if `v` expression conditional operator used in
	compatibility mode, as no variant of AT&T troff available to me
	recognizes it.  Distinguish compatibility mode once the letteral
	conditional expression operators are ruled out.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67408>.

2025-10-31  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/doc.tmac (doc-get-arg-type*): Handle the *roff internal
	string '.T' specially in an mdoc macro argument sequence; it is
	defined in the formatter, which _also_ defines a '.T'
	_register_, colliding perfectly with mdoc's argument type
	system.  This change prevents `.T` from being called as a macro
	and interpolating its value, a surprising outcome to mdoc users.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67646>.  Thanks to onf for
	the report.  Problem dates back "all the way"; not only does
	groff 1.22.3 (November 2014) have it, but the 4.4BSD-Lite2
	implementation of mdoc does as well.  mdoc as a *roff macro
	package implements its own bespoke type system to accompany its
	bespoke macro processor; the type of a macro argument (a string
	or macro) is determined by looking up its name as a _register_.
	mandoc(1) does not exhibit this problem because it does not use
	roff(7) registers to distinguish mdoc(7) child macros from
	plain-text macro arguments, so the .T register does not clash
	with the .T predefined string in the way it did in
	groff mdoc(7).

	[mdoc]: Regression-test Savannah #67646.

	* tmac/tests/doc_infer-correct-type-of-dot-T-string.sh: Add

	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac_TESTS): Run test.

2025-10-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/s.tmac (TE): Clarify logic.  Predicate early return on
	undefinedness of `TW` register, not whether we've issued a
	warning diagnostic regarding tbl failure.  While these two
	conditions are logically coupled (one complementing the other),
	we avoid performing post-tbl cleanup actions because tbl didn't
	run, not because we diagnosed that fact.

2025-10-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (table::do_bottom): Annotate
	generated *roff requests that avoid overprinting the bottom of a
	boxed table on nroff devices, to help anyone having to debug
	tbl's output maintain their sanity.

2025-10-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp: Rename macro storing name of *roff

	stop is only one character cell.  This behavior more closely
	resembles that of AT&T nroff.
	* src/devices/grotty/TODO: Delete.  Its only item is resolved.

	* doc/doc.am: Build PDF documents more carefully.
	(DOC_PDFMOM): Add environment variable `GROFF_COMMAND`, newly

	build environment's $PATH.

	[gropdf]: Make pdfmom able to run the build tree's groff.

	* src/devices/gropdf/pdfmom.pl: Add new global scalar `groff` to
	store the name/location of the groff command to run.  Default
	its value to "groff", but override it with the contents of the
	environment variable `GROFF_COMMAND` if that exists.  Update
	hard-coded "groff" literals with interpolations of this scalar.
	This interface is deliberately not documented in the man page,
	since it's intended for the use of groff's build system.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67618>.  Problem appears
	to date back to pdfmom's birth in commit f2a501fff5, 31 August
	2012.

2025-10-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[gropdf]: Make pdfmom disclose version of groff it runs.

	* src/devices/gropdf/pdfmom.pl: When handling `-v`/`--version`
	option, run "groff" with the `--version` option as well, as our
	other wrapper programs nroff(1) and groff(1) do.  This makes it
	easy to see if the versions of the various programs in the
	pipeline are askew.

2025-10-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Refactor recent change (to diagnose ignored characters
	on input lines after `\c` escape sequence) to catch the problem
	earlier in processing and report more information (before it is
	lost by calling into member functions of the `environment`
	class).

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::add_char): Drop
	just-added logic to handle case when `was_line_interrupted` is
	true.  Add initial `assert()` to check desired invariant: we
	shouldn't reach this member function when a line has been
	interrupted.
	* src/roff/troff/env.h (class environment): Add accessor member
	function `get_was_line_interrupted()` for private Boolean member
	variable `was_line_interrupted`.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (process_input_stack): Check line
	interruption status of current environment when processing
	tokens of type `TOKEN_CHAR`, `TOKEN_INDEXED_CHAR`, and
	`TOKEN_SPECIAL_CHAR`; skip the usual actions taken if that
	status is true, and throw a warning in category "syntax"
	instead.

2025-10-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (process_input_stack): Rename
	`suppress_next` local variable to `ignore_next_token`, and
	demote it from `int` to `bool`.  Assign to it with Boolean
	rather than integer literals.

2025-10-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::add_char): Throw syntax
	warning upon encountering formattable ordinary or special

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp: Fix code style nits.
	(environment::add_hyphen_indicator): Wrap long input line and

	formally complex expression.
	(environment::newline): Compare integer variable explicitly to
	integer literal value instead of punning down to a Boolean.

2025-10-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.  Rename `line_interrupted` member
	variable of class `environment` to `was_line_interrupted`; since
	it stores a Boolean value, its name should clearly imply a
	logical predicate.  Rename `environment`'s member variable
	`was_previous_line_interrupted` analogously--even though it is
	an `int` because it is a kludgy three-valued Boolean.  (The
	extra value encodes whether a formatter exit is underway, I
	think.)  Rename member function `get_prev_line_interrupted()` to
	`get_was_previous_line_interrupted()` analogously.  Rename (and
	unabbreviate) `saved_prev_line_interrupted` member variable of
	class `diversion` to `saved_was_previous_line_interrupted`
	analogously.

	[ms]: Support floating keeps on cover page.  (Traditionally, a
	cover page is exactly that--a page, singular, and therefore
	support for floating keeps should be unnecessary.  But letting a
	content reviewer scold a document author for letting a keep
	float to a second "cover" page seems less bad than the macro
	package throwing difficult-to-comprehend diagnostic messages.)

	* tmac/s.tmac: Initialize new Boolean-valued global register
	`@is-initialized` as false on startup.  Initialize the `k` and
	`nf` environments at startup, and copy their properties from
	environment `0`.
	(@init): Stop initializing `nf` environment here.  Make
	`@is-initialized` true.
	(KF): Call `par@reset-env` and `par@reset` only if the package
	is initialized.  If it isn't, these macros are not yet defined.

2025-10-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/s.tmac: Issue helpful diagnostic if it looks like the
	user failed to preprocess a document calling `TE`.  Add new
	register `tbl*was-tbl-failure-reported` and new macro
	`tbl*check-for-tbl`, which sets the register.
	(TE): Call the new macro.  If the failure has been reported,
	tbl has not run, so we can skip the rest of this macro.

2025-10-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[ms]: Fix Savannah #64529.

	* tmac/s.tmac: Manage keeps and initialize package more
	robustly.
	(TS): If the first macro call seen in a document is `TS`, call
	`cov*ab-init` directly instead of going through `LP`, which
	automatically closes an open diversion.
	(KE): Track whether we closed a diversion in new module register
	`kp*did-closure-succeed`, initializing its Boolean value to
	zero.  After existing logic calling appropriate closure macros,
	test the register again, and issue a diagnostic only if it is
	not true.
	(kp*end, kp*fend): Set `kp*did-closure-succeed`.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64529>.  Thanks to Doug
	McIlroy for the report (way back in 2011!).  Problem is at least
	that old.

	one has to pay extra attention when copying and pasting between
	groff man and groff mdoc.  When continuously rendering, truncate
	page length to vertical drawing position only after formatting
	the last document on the input stream.  This way, when troff
	emits diagnostic messages regarding the output, it reports a
	position of the form "page 1, line N", where "N" is a number you
	can usefully give to `sed -n Np` in a pipeline after

	rendering, don't put 1.3 million blank lines (`\n[.R]/1v`) on
	the output.

	* tmac/an.tmac ([initialization]): Initialize registers and
	strings accessed by trap-called macros, since the end of input
	springs several of them.
	(TH): Move end-of-input macro setup from here...
	([initialization]): ...to here.
	(TH): We now no longer need the `an-TH-was-called` register, so
	stop creating it...
	(an*end-document): ...stop removing it, and stop checking its
	existence.  Also, when continuously rendering, update the page
	length immediately after writing the footer, just as our mdoc(7)
	package does.

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.

	Tidy up the name space a bit.  We had two `enum`s declaring
	symbols starting with `HYPHEN_` (and another variable of
	`symbol` type that does as well).  Reduce those two to one,
	renaming the elements of the `enum` that manage the hyphenation
	state of the node list in the pending output line (cf. the
	hyphenation properties of characters themselves) to start with
	`HYPHENATE_` instead.

2025-10-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Slightly refactor.

	Nothing outside of "env.cpp" calls the global function
	`hyphenate()`.  In fact, it has only one call site.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp: Add forward declaration.
	  (hyphenation): Mark function as `static`.
	* src/roff/troff/node.h: Drop declaration.

2025-09-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-ext.tmac: Tweak `EX`/`EE` behavior for more flexible
	customization of typeface when using typesetters.  Stop
	assigning value "R" to string `mC` in nroff mode.  This way it's
	straightforwardly overridable in a "man.local" file, and the
	user doesn't have to override it differently for nroff mode.
	(EX): Select font "R" explicitly in nroff mode; a typesetter's
	constant-width font name won't be meaningful to a terminal
	output driver, except in the (unlikely?) case that an
	installation configures a style name as `mC`'s value.  (Unless
	man(7) pages are then formatted with "troff -fC -man" or
	similar to force a monospaced font for the entire document,
	doing this would largely trash the utility of example displays.)

2025-09-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/tests/html-device-works-with-grn-and-eqn.sh:
	Make test more sensitive.  While the infinite loop introduced in
	commit c71b4ef4aa and later fixed has not regressed, the input
	document does not produce usable output.  Look for that usable
	output.  That makes the test fail.  Unfortunately this is not
	evidence of a recent defect; groff 1.23.0, 1.22.4, and 1.22.3
	fail the same way with this input.  Therefore...
	* src/roff/groff/groff.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Mark it as an expected
	failure.

	* src/roff/troff/hvunits.h (hunits operator -): Fix misleading
	warning diagnostic arising from copy-and-paste error; the
	saturating operation is multiplication, not subtraction (when
	not decrementing, "-256" <=> "-1*256").

2025-09-18  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp: Refactor.
	(dbreak_node::asciify): Replace call of

	call of the `none` contained node's `asciify()` member function.
	(asciify_reverse_node_list): Drop function with no remaining
	call sites.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67509> (considered in

2025-09-18  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac:
	* tmac/doc.tmac: Man pages more often use the neutral double
	quote `"` as a "code literal" than as a quotation character.
	Give it the same (empty) set of character flags as its special
	character equivalent, \[dq].  This means that it is no longer
	transparent to sentence endings.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67474>.  Thanks to Alex
	Colomar and Russ Allbery for the discussion.

2025-09-18  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/fallbacks.tmac: Define different fallbacks for accented
	non-Latin-1 Latin characters, using one ordering for nroff-mode
	devices and another for troff-mode devices.  We assume that the
	former can't constructively overstrike and the latter can.

	On troff-mode devices, it can make sense to use the `asciify`
	request to serialize special characters in device extension
	commands, and in that case we want to write the base glyph
	before any combining ones.

	On non-constructively overstriking devices, the last character
	written at the drawing position "wins"; we want that to be the
	base glyph.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66653>.  Thanks to Deri
	James for pushing device extension commands to the limit,
	exposing this defect.

2025-09-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Refactor `node` class hierarchy.  Make `node` an
	abstract class.  The `asciify` feature had several bugs, and I
	think it's because the class design permitted derived classes to
	reuse the `node` base class's `asciify` member function, which
	robotically appended the `this` object to the macro pointed to
	in the function argument.  In most cases, the correct
	"asciification" of a node is to do nothing, discarding it.
	Rather than making the member function empty in the base class,
	I prefer to make the base class abstract to force conscious
	consideration of how objects of each derived class should be
	"asciified".

	* src/roff/troff/node.h: Mark `add_char()`, `asciify()`, and
	`add_italic_correction()` member functions as `virtual`.
	Further mark `asciify` as _pure_ virtual (notation: "= 0").

	conditionally depending on the node contents.  Why stop deleting
	them?  Because the node list is actually a list of (potential)
	trees; some nodes can contain further nodes, and so on
	recursively.  It's difficult, and there is no need, to mark the
	root of each tree in the list so that we can return to it later
	to delete it; instead what we can do is have the `asciify`
	request walk the list again and perform a delete operation,
	which due to the class hierarchy design will automatically be a
	complete, recursive operation.  There is no reason _not_ to do
	this because the whole point of `asciify` is to convert nodes
	back into some form of text; the idiomatic application (and only
	one, as seen in "om.tmac" and "e.tmac") is to convert diversions
	into PDF bookmarks or HTML URLs that are embedded in a document

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (asciify_macro): When asciifying a

	the copy (which in many cases produces nothing), and delete the

	in an irreversibly transformed macro/string/diversion.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/asciify-request-works.sh: Add test cases
	for transformation of nodes produced by leaders and tabs.

2025-09-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/tests/asciify-request-works.sh: Add test case

	leader) escape sequence.

2025-09-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: "Asciify" token nodes as nothing.  Token nodes are used
	only internally to manipulate the input stream; they don't
	directly correspond to any sort of document feature.

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (class token_node): Declare `asciify`
	member function, thus overriding base class.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (token_node::asciify): Plant land mine
	with `assert()`.  Delete the `this` object and return.

2025-09-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: "Asciify" (plain) space nodes as nothing.  (Plain space
	nodes--contrast word space nodes and others--are produced by the
	formatter with a width of zero (`H0`) in nearly all cases.  The
	exception is when a space node is copied, in which case the
	destination space node gets whatever width its source had.)

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (space_node::asciify): Simplify;
	member function now simply deletes `this`.

2025-09-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/tests/asciify-request-works.sh: Add test case

2025-09-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (unbreakable_space_node::asciify):
	Asciify an unbreakable space node (the kind produced by the `\~`
	escape sequence) as an ordinary space instead of an
	`ESCAPE_TILDE` token.  The latter is not necessary for the
	`asciify` request's revised charter (and only known application
	to date) of making diversion contents fit for use as device
	extension command arguments.

	Asciify a space character horizontal motion node (the kind
	produced by the `\ ` unadjustable space escape sequence) as an
	ordinary space instead of an `ESCAPE_SPACE` token.  The latter
	is not necessary for the `asciify` request's revised charter

2025-09-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (hmotion_node::asciify): Stop
	asciifying a horizontal motion node that was a tab character as
	a tab; instead delete it like any other horizontal motion.  We
	have no semantics for tab characters in, for example, the
	parameters of device extension commands.  Ensure that the node
	object is deleted on every path through the function (now
	trivial).
	* src/roff/groff/tests/asciify-request-works.sh: Add test cases
	for transformation of nodes produced by `\t` and `\h` escape
	sequences.

2025-09-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp: Add more `assert()`ions and validity
	checks to node classes' `asciify()` member functions, eliminate
	unnecessary statements, and more consistently delete node
	objects after `asciify`-ing them.  (The `asciify` request
	modifies a macro/string/diversion--usually a diversion--in
	place.)
	(kern_pair_node::asciify, ligature_node::asciify): `assert()`
	that each of the contained nodes is not a null pointer and do
	not recursively `asciify()` them if they are.
	(asciify_reverse_node_list): `assert()` that macro and node
	pointer arguments are not null, and return early if they are.
	(dbreak_node::asciify): `assert()` that macro pointer argument
	is not null, and do not call `asciify_reverse_node_list()` on it
	if it is.  Also drop dead store (pointless assignment) to member
	variable just before deleting the object.
	(break_char_node::asciify, italic_corrected_node::asciify)
	(left_italic_corrected_node::asciify): `assert()` that macro
	pointer argument is not null, and do not recursively `asciify()`
	it if it is.  Also drop dead store (pointless assignment) to
	member variable just before deleting the object.

2025-09-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (class charinfo_node): Make class more
	obviously abstract--the obvious intention of the hierarchy--by
	annotating it and marking member functions (apart from the
	constructor) as `virtual`.

2025-09-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/tests/asciify-request-works.sh: Add test cases

	[gropdf]: Handle TTF->PFB converted fonts better, and restore
	cut'n'paste handling of '\-' mapped to U+2212.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (FindChr): Some fonts invent
	Unicode Code Points for characters which have no sanctioned UCP,
	use the base UCP.
	(LoadFont): Handle 6 char UCPs.
	(LoadFont, AssignGlyph): Restore functionality of mapping U+2212
	{minus} to U+002D (hyphen) when cutting and pasting from a pdf.
	(Subset): Other 'naughty' fonts use hyphen(s) when assigning a
	postscript name to a glyph (e.g. 'f-f-i'), allow it.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (vmotion_node::asciify): New member

2025-08-31  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: "Asciify" device extension nodes as nothing,
	suppressing non-actionable diagnostic message.  (Device
	extension nodes are produced by the `device` and `devicem`

	values of `unsigned char` type.

2025-08-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/glyphuni.cpp: Stop mapping the special
	character `ru` (baseline rule) to U+005F.  The Unicode "LOW
	LINE" is a not a baseline rule (while my DEC VT525's character
	set disagrees, the fonts on my GNU/Linux box do not).  `ru` and
	`bs` (the Bell System logo) are the only special characters
	groff internally defines that have no Unicode representation.
	GNU troff offers the `char` request, enabling a document to
	define `\[ru]` as equivalent to `_` if it wishes.

	Discovered while looking into Savannah #66653.

2025-08-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp: Trivially refactor.  `unsigned char`
	is a _numeric_ type, not a character type (properly considered).
	Compare values of this type to unsigned numeric literals, not to
	character literals that are to be used with `char`, which is of
	undefined signedness.  Reorder equality comparisons to avoid
	inadvertent lvalue assignment.
	(troff_output_file::put_char_width, troff_output_file::put_char)
	(glyph_node::get_hyphenation_type, node::asciify)
	(composite_node::dump_properties, make_glyph_node): Do it.
	(charinfo_node::dump_properties): Perform explicit comparison to
	unsigned numeric literal instead of letting its value pun down
	to a Boolean.

2025-08-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Make `-c` option neuter the `color` request.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Add `permit_color_output` static
	Boolean variable.
	(activate_color): Introduce `is_color_desired` local Boolean.
	If `permit_color_output` is false and color enablement is
	attempted, refuse with an error diagnostic.
	(main): `-c` option configures value of `permit_color_output`
	rather than `want_color_output`.

	* font/devpdf/devpdf.am: Rationalize use of make(1) macros for
	intelligibility and to fix a missing-prerequisite bug.
	(DEVPDFFONTFILES_FROM_DEVPS): Rename this...
	(devpdffont_descriptions_from_devps): ...to this.  Not all
	"files" are font descriptions, and we need a macro to track only
	the latter.
	(DEVPDFFONTFILES_FOR_URW): Rename this...
	(devpdffont_descriptions_for_urw): ...to this for similar
	reasons.
	(DEVPDFFONTFILES): Rename and rescope this...
	(devpdffontdescriptions): ...to this.  Retain the "SS" font
	description file in its expansion but drop "symbolsl.{afm,pfb}"
	and "download"...
	(devpdffontdata): ...moving them here, along with the expansion
	of `devpdffontdescriptions`.
	(font/devpdf/download): Depend on the expansion of
	`devpdffont_descriptions_from_devps`.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67415>.  Thanks to Bjarni
	Ingi Gislason for the report and analysis.  Problem introduced
	{I think--its exposure required "make --shuffle"} by me in
	commit bace292caf, 29 June.

2025-08-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (table::print_single_hrule): When
	drawing a horizontal rule in a boxed table, also draw vertical
	rules at the table edges in nroff mode such that grotty(1)
	correctly detects horizontal and vertical rule intersections,
	producing correct box-drawing glyphs on the "utf8" device.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67420>.  This bug could be
	characterized as an incomplete feature requiring cooperation
	between tbl and grotty.  One could date the problem back to the
	introduction of "utf8" output device support in January 2000
	{released in groff 1.16, May 2000}, or the addition of Unicode
	box-drawing character support to represent rule intersections in
	grotty in July 2003 (released in groff 1.19.1, May 2004).

2025-08-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/ms.ms.in: Revise parameter table layout.  Make it fit
	better on nroff-mode devices.  It now requires 74n instead of

2025-08-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/ms.ms: Rename this...
	* doc/ms.ms.in: ...to this.
	* doc/doc.am (DOCFILES_INST): Drop "doc/ms.ms".
	(DOCFILES_NOINST): Add "doc/ms.ms.in".
	(GENERATEDDOCFILES): Add "doc/ms.ms".
	(SUFFIXES): Add "ms.in" and ".ms", in that order, duplicating
	the dubious, nonstandard, but apparently portable and effective
	make(1) trick we use for our me(7) manuals.
	(.ms.in.ms): New suffix rule creates "ms.ms" from "ms.ms.in".

	instead of the source directory.

2025-08-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/s.tmac ([initialization], pg@top): Alter placement of
	page footer, shifting it upward by one vee, so that the size of
	the "footer margin" (register `FM`) measures as documented, and
	consistently with the "header margin" (register `HM`).  While a
	bug fix, and consistent with DWB 3.3 ms, it is inconsistent with
	Seventh Edition Unix ms and Heirloom Doctools ms.

	[grolbp,grotty,pre-grohtml,preconv,groff]: Slightly refactor.
	Get `usage()` functions out of the business of `exit()`ing,
	which they were doing only in successful cases.  (The calling
	scope `exit()`s with status 2 on usage errors.)  This was
	discrepant with grodvi, post-grohtml, grolj4, grops, eqn, grn,
	pic, refer, soelim, tbl, addftinfo, hpftodit, indxbib, lkbib,
	lookbib, pfbtops, tfmtodit, and xtotroff.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl: Trivially refactor to fix a Perl
	warning.
	(warn): Rename this subroutine...

	(infer_man_or_ms_package, construct_command): Update call sites.

2025-08-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl: Fix code style nit.  Stop using `&`
	sigil in subroutine calls; that's nonidiomatic Perl, an
	exception to the language's otherwise relentless dedication to
	sigil prefixes.

	* tmac/doc.tmac ([initialization]): Configure end-of-input macro
	unconditionally, even on degenerate inputs that never call `Dd`.
	This prevents an insane page length from being used when
	continuous rendering is enabled.
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-common (Dd): Stop doing so here.

	Schwarze.

	* font/devpdf/util/BuildFoundries.pl (RunAfmtodit): Run
	`afmtodit` with the new `-q` flag.  Recent versions of the URW
	fonts have tons of duplicate mappings (for groff's purposes) and
	to our knowledge these are all harmless; we don't want to
	distress people attentive to the messages scrolling by in an
	otherwise unremarkable groff build.

2025-08-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.pl: Add `-q` command-line option
	to suppress diagnostics reporting duplicate mappings in favor of
	a count thereof.  Add new `opt_q` and `duplicate_mappings_count`
	scalars.  Update `GetOptions()` call.  Implement the logic.
	_Don't_ report the flag in the header of the generated file.
	If the option was given and any duplicate mappings were
	encountered, report the count to the standard error stream
	before exiting.
	* src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.1.man (Options, Diagnostics):
	Document it.

2025-08-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.pl: Trivially refactor, renaming
	scalar `prog` to `program_name`.
	(usage): Use that scalar instead of `$0` when reporting
	program's identity.  Drop incorrect annotation.  This new
	behavior is consistent with groff's other installed programs.

2025-08-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/soelim/soelim.cpp (do_so): Throw warning if input
	document backslash-escapes a space in a `so` token argument.  As
	the diagnostic message notes, doing so is not compatible with
	{any} troff's syntax, and is (now, in GNU soelim and troff)
	unnecessary for handling of spacey file names.

	[mdoc]: Make man page rendering more robust against meddling
	with the adjustment mode by individual pages.  In part this is
	to ensure that meddling doesn't persist outside the meddlesome
	document when rendering multiple pages, but it also makes user
	preferences more reliably discernible.  Prompted by a discussion
	with Russ Allbery (about man(7)) in late 2023.

	* tmac/doc.tmac ([initialization]): When rendering a man page,
	this macro file is read before any mdoc(7) document; therefore,
	if the `AD` string is set, we know it was specified on the
	command line or by the "mdoc.local" file.  Stash its value in
	new string `andoc*AD` so it can be recovered after meddling by
	the document.
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-common (Dd): Remove the potentially page-local
	`AD` string when starting a new document, and call
	`an*reset-adjustment-mode` interpolating `andoc*AD` as an
	argument to impose the user's preference (or the package
	default) at each new document.
	(doc-reset-adjustment-mode): New macro assumes responsibility
	for configuring adjustment.  Accept an argument, and if valid,
	assign its contents to the `AD` string.
	(Sh): Configure adjustment _after_ determining formatting
	parameters dependent on the name of the section heading.  Move
	`na` request out of control branch matching the `doc-sec-head`
	and `doc-section-synopsis` strings.  Later, invoke `na` if we're
	in a synopsis section and `doc-reset-adjustment-mode` otherwise.
	(Ss): Invoke `na` if we're in a synopsis section and
	`doc-reset-adjustment-mode` otherwise.

	* tmac/tests/doc_user-preferred-adjustment-restored.sh: Add test
	to verify preservation of user-selected adjustment mode.

	otherwise.
	(Ss): Invoke `nh` if we're in a synopsis section and

	"paragraph reset", but this input trap is also (and
	predominantly) used by macros that perform "inline" style
	changes (`B`, `I`, `SM`, and so on).  A paragraph reset can
	alter adjustment and hyphenation modes, and we _don't_ want that

	[mdoc]: Refactor to simplify hyphenation handling.

	* tmac/mdoc/doc-common (doc-reset-hyphenation-mode): Refactor to
	simplify.  Now that continuous rendering mode is handled via a
	humongous page length, it's no longer necessary for this macro
	package to use a different hyphenation mode in continuous
	rendering mode.  (It formerly was, because the [invisible]
	bottom of each output page had what our documentation terms an
	"implicit page trap", causing hyphenation to be suppressed on
	some output lines for no obvious reason.)  We no longer have to
	dance around that: kill the logic for it.

	* tmac/tests/localization-works.sh: Add test cases for use of
	mdoc with every locale supported by groff.

2025-07-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[mdoc]: Refactor hyphenation mode handling.

	* tmac/doc.tmac: Refactor.
	([initialization]): Stop assigning `HY` register a default value
	if it's unspecified by the user (on the command line or via
	"man.local").
	(doc-reset-args): Stop resetting hyphenation mode here;
	replacing it with a call to `doc-reset-hyphenation-mode` causes
	infinite macro recursion.  (Will this bite us later?)
	(doc-print-reference): Call `doc-reset-hyphenation-mode` instead
	of manipulating automatic hyphenation mode directly.
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-common ([initialization]): Drop logic that sets
	up `doc-hyphen-flags` register, which we're retiring in favor of
	a new macro.
	(Dd, Nd): Call `doc-reset-hyphenation-mode`.  The lack of a
	hyphenation mode reset in the latter macro was apparently an
	oversight, caught by a forthcoming automated test.
	(doc-reset-hyphenation-mode): New macro works if the `HY`
	register is not defined.  Use new local register
	`doc-want-hyphenation` to determine which hyphenation mode
	ultimately gets set (that of the locale, or zero).  Remove
	register when done.
	(Sh): Call `doc-reset-hyphenation-mode` instead of manipulating
	automatic hyphenation mode directly.

2025-07-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[mdoc]: Disable hyphenation less aggressively.

	* tmac/doc.tmac (doc-parse-args, doc-parse-arg-vector)
	(doc-enclose-close, doc-inset-list, doc-hang-list)
	(doc-ohang-list, doc-diag-list, doc-tag-list, Fc)
	(doc-print-reference): Stop invoking `nh` request.  This
	package's bespoke internal macro reprocessing system
	aggressively exercises Savannah #67310 (a missing feature in the
	formatter); with these requests in place, automatic hyphenation
	was getting disabled in far more places than it should have
	been, and because there appears to be no mechanism for
	reënabling it when departing the appropriate nested scope, it's
	simpler to just stop trying.  Making this change had little
	effect on formatting of groff_mdoc(7), except for the following.
	  {1} URL link text, when it was the URL itself (as on output
	      devices that don't support hyperlinking) was undesirably
	      hyphenated, but see below;
	  {2} text not otherwise marked up between `Rs` and `Re` macros
	      is now subject to automatic hyphenation; and
	  {3} text marked with the `Me` macro is now subject to
	      automatic hyphenation.
	Changes {2} and {3} seem correct.
	(Lk): Macro now does what more mdoc(7) documents should probably
	have already been doing: employ the `\%` escape sequence in
	appropriate places.  (Alternatively, those who enjoy mandoc(1)'s
	approach can disable automatic hyphenation altogether at
	formatting time by setting the `HY` register to zero in
	"mdoc.local" or on the command line.)  This change eliminates
	the one regression noted above.

	* tmac/tests/doc_indents-correctly.sh: Update test expectations,

	* tmac/an.tmac (an*reset-paragraph-parameters): Call
	`an*reset-hyphenation-mode`.
	(TH): Stop calling `an*reset-hyphenation-mode`.
	* tmac/groff_man.7.man.in (Paragraphing macros): Document
	paragraphing macros' restoration of configured hyphenation mode.

2025-07-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac: Refactor to simplify.
	(an*reset-hyphenation-mode): Now that continuous rendering mode
	is handled via a humongous page length, it's no longer necessary
	for this macro package to use a different hyphenation mode in
	continuous rendering mode.  (It formerly was, because the
	{invisible} bottom of each output page had what our
	documentation terms an "implicit page trap", causing hyphenation
	to be suppressed on some output lines for no obvious reason.)
	We no longer have to dance around that: kill the logic for it.

	* tmac/tests/localization-works.sh: Drop sensitivity to
	continuous rendering mode.

2025-07-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac: Refactor.
	(an*reset-hyphenation-mode): Update to work if the `HY` register
	is not defined.  Use new local register `an*want-hyphenation` to
	determine which hyphenation mode ultimately gets set (that of
	the locale, or zero).  Remove register when done.
	([initialization]): Stop assigning `HY` register a default value
	if it's unspecified by the user (on the command line or via
	"man.local").

2025-07-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac: Refactor.
	(an*reset-paragraph-parameters): New macro resets the font
	style, type size, and vertical spacing, but not the line length.
	(TH, an*input-trap, an*break-paragraph): Call it instead of
	invoking the corresponding requests directly.
	(TH, P, HP): Reset line length to configured `LL` register
	value.
	(TH): Reset indentation to zero.  A well-formed man(7) document
	formats no text between a `TH` call and an `SH` call, but a
	predictable indentation is useful for crafting test cases.

2025-07-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac: Slightly refactor.
	(TH, SH, SS): Rearrange macro calls to place
	`an*reset-section-parameters` before calls of macros that adjust
	formatting parameters of smaller scope.  This should (and, per
	our automated tests, does) produce no behavioral changes; it's
	for clarity to macro package maintainers and source divers.

2025-07-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

2025-07-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/scripts/gendesc.sh:
	* font/scripts/genfonts.sh: Exit with status 2, not 255, on

	[troff]: Trivially refactor, continuing naming reform of
	functions that are troff request handlers and which lists of

	{debugging} request handlers, and reserve `dump` for member
	functions of classes.  (One might use the latter from within

2025-07-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/eqnrc: Drop unneccessary setup.  Since commit 4b3e5417d5,

2025-07-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/addftinfo/addftinfo.cpp: Fix code style nits.  Give
	the anonymous `struct` type used for `param_table` a name,

	C++98-conformantly.
	(main): Use `array_length()` on `param_table` instead of
	`sizeof` and division.

2025-07-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/refer/label.ypp: Give the anonymous `struct` types

	suffix to the object names to create the type names.

2025-07-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/preconv/preconv.cpp: Fix code style nits.  Spell
	null pointer constant the idiomatic C++98 way (`0`) instead of
	as `NULL`.  Boolify: demote global variable `raw_flag` from
	`int` to `bool`, and rename it to `want_raw_output`.
	(get_BOM): Give the anonymous `struct` type used for `BOM_table`
	a name, and move it into the global scope (it was already
	`static`), so that it can be passed to a template function
	C++98-conformantly.  Use `array_length()` on `BOM_table` instead
	of `sizeof` and division.
	(is_comment_line, do_file): Demote return type from `int` to
	`bool`, and return Boolean rather than integer literals.
	(do_file): Boolify: demote variable `must_free_encoding` from

	to it.  Demote variable `success` from `int` to `bool`, rename
	it to `was_successful`, and assign Boolean rather than integer
	literals to it.
	(emacs2mime, check_coding_tag, detect_file_encoding, do_file)
	(main): Explicitly compare values of pointer type to null
	pointer literals instead of letting them pun down to Booleans.
	(conversion_iconv, do_file): Favor C++ `static_cast<>` and
	`const_cast<>` operators over omnipotent C-style casts.
	(conversion_iconv, main): Parenthesize (formally) complex

	(do_file): Assign character rather than integer literal to
	element of `char` array.

2025-07-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	its end-of-support date.

2025-07-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/pic/pic.ypp: Fix code style nit.  Give the

	function C++98-conformantly.  Lamely, apply an `_s` suffix to
	the object names to create the type names.

2025-07-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/eqn/lex.cpp: Fix code style nits.  Sort libgroff
	header files before program-specific ones.  Give the anonymous
	`struct` type used for `token_table` a name, so that it can be
	passed to a template function C++98-conformantly.
	(init_table): Use `array_length()` on `token_table`,
	`common_defs`, `troff_defs`, and `mathml_defs` instead of
	`sizeof` and division.

2025-07-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp: Fix code style nits.  Give the
	anonymous `struct` type used for `table` a name, so that it
	can be passed to a template function C++98-conformantly.  Give
	`table` a better name: `numeric_directive_table`.  Now that
	their enclosures have better names, give the `numeric_directive`
	`struct` element `numeric_directive` the better name `name`.
	(font::load_desc): Track renames.  Use a `size_t` as the loop
	index.  Parenthesize (formally) complex pexpressions.  Use
	`array_length()` on `numeric_directive_table` instead of
	`sizeof` and division.

2025-07-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/grolj4/lj4.cpp (lookup_paper_size): Sanity-check
	the size of the `paper_table` array.  It's statically defined,
	so only hacking on the source can violate the invariant.

2025-07-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/grolj4/lj4.cpp: Relocate definition of
	`lookup_paper_size()`, eliminating need for forward declaration.

2025-07-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/xditview/DviP.h: Fix code style nit.  Give the

	anonymous `struct` type used for `paper_table` a name, so
	that it can be passed to a template function C++98-conformantly.
	(lookup_paper_size): Use a `size_t` as the loop index.  Use
	`array_length()` on `paper_table` instead of `sizeof` and
	division.  Change return type to `ssize_t` so that we can
	continue to return `-1` meaning "not found".
	(main): Change type of local variable `n` to match altered
	return type of `lookup_paper_size()`.

2025-07-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/grolbp/lbp.cpp: Fix code style nits.  Give the
	anonymous `struct` type used for `lbp_papersizes` a name, so
	that it can be passed to a template function C++98-conformantly.
	(set_papersize): Use `array_length()` on `lbp_papersizes`
	instead of `sizeof` and division.
	(wp54charset, lbp_printer::vdmflush): `sizeof` is an operator,
	not a function, so don't parenthesize its operand when it's an
	lvalue (as opposed to a type name).

	[troff]: Catch `std::bad_alloc` exceptions from `new` operator.
	Throw a fatal error indicating how much memory we couldn't
	allocate.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_long_escape_parameters)
	(do_get_long_name, get_delimited_name): Do it.

2025-07-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Refactor to simplify.  As an
	apparent optimization (dating back as far as groff 1.02, 1991)
	parts of the input parser that needed to read arbitrarily far
	ahead in the input stream to consume a token used an initial
	stack-allocated buffer of 16 bytes.  (Also known as "automatic"
	storage, thus the name "abuf", I think.)  If 16 bytes wasn't
	enough, open-coded logic would allocate a buffer from the heap
	and double it in size until the token fit.  Simplify by
	converting `ABUF_SIZE` from a preprocessor macro to a `const`
	symbol named `default_buffer_size`, and _always_ allocate from
	the heap.  In the future, we can convert stuff like this to a
	C++ STL `vector` and let the standard library worry about
	dynamic storage management.
	(read_long_escape_parameters, do_get_long_name)
	(get_delimited_name): Do it.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Fix code style nits.
	(read_long_escape_parameters, read_escape_parameter)

	Reorder equality comparisons to avoid inadvertent lvalue
	assignment.  Compare objects of `char` type to character, not
	integer, literals.

2025-07-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_long_escape_parameters):
	Slightly refactor.  Test for an empty argument (or argument
	sequence) earlier, before worrying about whether the input
	buffer just populated is still the stack-allocated one or was
	relocated to the heap.  This is to facilitate a simplification
	of input buffer management.

2025-07-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_rest_of_line_as_argument):
	Trivially refactor.  Rename local variable `len` to `buf_size`,
	for consistency with several other functions in this file that
	handle memory buffers.  Reorder equality comparisons to avoid
	inadvertent lvalue assignment.  Parenthesize (formally) complex
	expressions.

2025-07-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

2025-07-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp (get_resolution)
	(get_image_generator): Track the line number in the files we
	read to process the "resolution" and "image_generator"
	directives (see groff_font(5)).  Pass the line number and
	resolved file name for the file thus opened to `get_line()`.
	(get_line): Update definition to accept these new arguments.
	{We don't yet do anything with them.}

2025-07-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp (get_resolution)
	(get_image_generator): Slightly refactor.  Free `pathp` _after_
	we've looped through all the lines in the file we've opened
	instead of before.  This is to prepare for a change where we
	pass `pathp` to `get_line()` as a new argument.

2025-07-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp (get_line): Slightly refactor.
	Use named variables more and constant literals less.

2025-07-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp (get_line): Fix code style nits.
	Boolify: demote return type from `int` to `bool`, and return
	Boolean rather than integer literals.  Mark as `static` since
	this function requires no external linkage.  Reorder equality
	comparisons to avoid inadvertent lvalue assignment.

	Retire our `strerror()` implementation.  It was specified in

	"lex.cpp" continues to, when interpreting eqn input proper).
	The idea is that eqn, like grn, pic, refer, soelim, and tbl, is

	(install-html-local): Name as prerequisites (only) the macros
	conditionally populated when `HAVE_MAKEINFO` and `USE_TEX` are
	defined.  Thus we (re)build each document only if we can
	actually do so.  If not, the user gets the "stock" version from
	distribution archive.

2025-07-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am: Trivially refactor.  Rename `install_infodoc`
	target to `install-info-local` and `install-txt` to
	`install-txt-local` for consistency with
	`install-{dvi,pdf,html}-local`.

	[devpdf]: Ship AFM file for slanted symbol font.

	* font/devpdf/devpdf.am (DEVPDFFONTFILES): Add it.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Distribute its (contrived) ".in" file.
	($(devpdf_builddir)/symbolsl.afm): Add rule to contrive it.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.1.man (Files): Document it.

2025-07-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[devpdf]: Add Makefile script for regenerating slanted symbol
	font.

	* font/devpdf/generate/Makefile: New file (re)creates AFM and
	PFB files for slanted symbol font from SFD source.  We emplace
	the files with ".in" suffixes so that they'll work with the
	groff build process in both in-tree and out-of-tree scenarios.
	* font/devpdf/generate/symbolsl.sfd: Update metadata to credit
	Deri with modifications.
	* font/devpdf/symbolsl.afm.in: New file.

2025-07-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[devpdf]: Rename slanted symbol font.  It's not a standard PDF
	font, so it's less misleading to omit "Standard" from its name.

	* font/devpdf/generate/StandardSymSL.sfd: Rename this...
	* font/devpdf/generate/symbolsl.sfd: ...to this...
	* font/devpdf/StandardSymSL.pfb.in: ...and this...
	* font/devpdf/symbolsl.pfb.in: ...to this.
	* font/devpdf/devpdf.am (DEVPDFFONTFILES): Update macro
	definition.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Update macro appendment.
	($(devpdf_builddir)/StandardSymSL.pfb): Rename target from
	this...
	($(devpdf_builddir)/symbolsl.pfb): ...to this.  Update
	prerequisite and rule to use new names.

	* font/devpdf/download.in: Update embeddable font file name.

	* src/util/pfbtops/tests/smoke-test.sh: Update test.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.1.man (Files): Reflect rename.

2025-07-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (LoadFont): Tweak warning
	diagnostic emitted when a "download" file entry is invalid
	{typically because the font file named there doesn't exist}.

2025-07-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.pl: Fix missing word in fatal
	diagnostic message.

2025-07-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (LoadDownload): Trivially
	refactor.  Rename scalar `anyDownloadFilefound` to
	`anyDownloadFileFound` for proper camel casery.

2025-07-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor, continuing naming reform of
	functions that are troff request handlers such that their names
	end with `_request`, and of member functions that write class
	object data to the standard error stream to `dump`.

	* src/roff/troff/env.h (class environment): Rename public member
	function `print_env` to `dump` in declaration.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::print_env): Rename
	this...
	(environment::dump): ...to this in definition.
	(dump_environment_request): Update call sites.
	(print_nodes_from_input_line): Rename this...
	(dump_pending_output_line_request): ...to this.
	(init_env_requests): Track latter rename in handler setup.

2025-07-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::print_env): Tweak output;
	describe current and previous font selections as "resolved",
	since if the font position of an abstract style is selected,
	that's not what shows up here, because the abstract style is
	combined with the default family.

2025-07-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[eqn]: Fix Savannah #67285.

	* src/preproc/eqn/main.cpp (read_line): Stop discarding invalid
	input characters, as this function doesn't know whether we're
	reading an eqn region.  Keep track of whether we've seen the
	default *roff escape character (`\`) and a `"` or `#`
	immediately after one.  If so, stop throwing warnings about
	these characters as well.  ("lex.cpp"'s
	`file_input::read_line()` independently checks for invalid
	character codes encountered when _interpreting_ the input.)

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67285>.  Problem dates
	back at least to groff 1.02, 2 June 1991.

	[eqn]: Regression-test Savannah #67285.

	* src/preproc/eqn/tests/\
	passes-through-input-with-eighth-bit-set.sh: Do it.
	* src/preproc/eqn/eqn.am (eqn_TESTS): Run test.

2025-07-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/eqn/main.cpp (main): Actually set
	`want_startup_file` to `false` when `-R` option is seen.
	Problem introduced by me in commit d22a547b9b, 27 August 2023.

2025-07-05  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[pic]: Adjust new polygon feature.  Adopt the term "reference
	points" for object-relative locators, and rename the `.p[oint]`
	specimen thereof to `.mid[point]`.

	* src/preproc/pic/lex.cpp (get_token_after_dot):
	* src/preproc/pic/yex.cpp: Rename `DOT_P` symbol/token to
	`DOT_MID`.
	* src/preproc/pic/lex.cpp (get_token_after_dot): Recognize `mid`
	and `midpoint`, rather than `p` and `point`, as token `DOT_MID`
	instead of `DOT_P`.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67250>.  Thanks to Doug
	McIlroy for the discussion.

2025-07-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/addftinfo/addftinfo.cpp (usage): Summarize purpose
	of command when help is requested.

2025-07-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp: Trivially refactor.  Use better data
	type for `deprecated_font_identifiers`; make a vector of
	`symbol`s rather than of `string`s.
	(warn_if_font_name_deprecated): Use compatible type for vector
	iterator.

2025-07-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[devps]: Stop generating "symbol.map" from "symbolchars".

	* font/devpdf/devpdf.am (devpdffontdata): Drop
	"font/devpdf/map/symbolchars".
	* font/devps/devps.am (DEVPSGENFILES): Drop "symbol.map" and
	"symbolchars".  Add "symbolsl.awk".
	* font/devps/generate/Makefile ($(srcdir)/symbol.map): Drop
	target.
	(clean): Stop cleaning "$(srcdir)/symbol.map".
	* font/devps/generate/symbolchars: Delete.

	Begins a build refactoring motivated by Savannah #66876.

2025-07-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.pl: Throw separate diagnostic
	messages for failures to open "DESC" files attempted from two
	separate locations.

2025-07-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.pl: Fix code style nits.  Stop
	using `&` sigil in subroutine calls; that's nonidiomatic Perl,
	an exception to the language's otherwise relentless dedication
	to sigil prefixes.

2025-07-01  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am ($(GROFF_INFO)) [HAVE_MAKEINFO]: Make target
	creation depend on `HAVE_MAKEINFO` configuration variable.

2025-06-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tty.tmac: Fix misspelled special character identifiers
	when defining fallback characters for accented basic Latin
	letters.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67259>.  Problem
	introduced by me in commit 8f9988d4eb, 25 August.  Thanks to
	Bjarni Ingi Gislason for the report.

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl: Trivially refactor.  Rename
	global list `idirs` to `includeDirs` so its purpose is clearer.
	Update dereference sites.

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (OpenFontFile): Refactor.  This
	subroutine no longer does anything with its second argument (of
	three), so eliminate it.
	(LoadDesc, LoadFont, GetType1): Update call sites.

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[gropdf]: Use stricter MS-DOS/Windows filespec check.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (OpenFontFile)
	(OpenIncludedFile): Make check for MS-DOS/Windows-style absolute
	filespec stricter; not only must the second character be ':',
	but the first must now be an uppercase Basic Latin letter.

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl: Refactor.
	(OpenInc): Rename this subroutine...
	(OpenIncludedFile): ...to this.  Also rename local scalars for
	clarity, and give them clearer semantics.  `fn` becomes `arg`,
	and is the untransformed actual parameter passed in.  Rename
	`fnm` to `fileName`, which is used only when the subroutine
	performs a transformation on `arg` (when it is not an absolute
	filespec, the code tries to locate it by prefixing with elements
	of the `idirs` list).
	(do_x): Update call site.

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (do_x): Trivially refactor.
	Rename scalar `FDnm` to `fileName`.

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (LoadDownload): Drop scalar `f`;
	we won't need it anymore.  Rename scalar `found` to
	`anyDownloadFilefound`, and manipulate it like a Boolean, not a
	counter.  Attempt `open()` of "download" in each directory in
	the groff font search path directly, instead of indirectly
	through `OpenFontFile()`; we want to read all download files
	available, not stop at the first one encountered.  Use an
	ordinary file handle (`DL`) for this `open()`; we don't need a
	scalar for it because we don't return it.  Issue `Notice()`s of
	each open, whether successful or failed.  Recast diagnostics.
	Annotate and motivate logic.

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (OpenFontFile): Refactor.  Rename
	scalar `fnm` to `fileName`.  Add scalar `resolvedFileName`,
	recording the file specification actually opened in the event of
	success.  Eliminate multiple returns.  Use global scalar
	`fontPath` instead of `dirs` argument to search for files.

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (OpenFile): Rename this...
	(OpenFontFile): ...to this, reflecting the specificity of its
	operation--it opens files corresponding to the output device in
	the `$GROFF_FONT_PATH` (or given to the program as `-F`
	arguments).

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl: Trivially refactor.  Rename
	global scalar `fontdir` to `fontPath` to better reflect its
	syntax.
	(LoadDownload, LoadDesc, LoadFont, GetType1): Update dereference
	sites.

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl: Recast diagnostic messages to
	describe the default foundry in a less confusing way.  Add new
	scalar, `foundryDescription`, to store the string "default
	foundry" when the foundry would otherwise be reported as an
	empty string, which could mislead the user into thinking that a
	variable has gone unintentionally unpopulated.
	(LoadFont): Update phrasing of diagnostics to work with new
	scalar.

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (LoadFont): Recast diagnostic
	message.

	Continues fixing Savannah #66519.

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (LoadFont): Add a `Notice()` of
	the key we're looking up in the `download` hash (or, if that
	fails, the `missing` hash).

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am (DOC_PDFMOM): Build documents more verbosely,
	passing `-P -d` option to pdfmom(1) (and ultimately `-d` to
	gropdf(1)).

2025-07-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/devpdf/util/BuildFoundries.pl (LoadFoundry): Stop
	throwing notice about grops(1) font [description file] being
	copied; this notification was far away from where the rewrite
	was actually happening.  Drop now-unused `gotf` scalar.
	(UseGropsVersion): If we're being strict and the destination
	font description file name (scalar `gfontbase`) already exists,
	emit a `Notice()` that we're not overwriting it.  If we are
	rewriting it, emit the aforementioned notice here, where it
	happens.  Drop redundant/unnecessary (depending on whether a
	file open was successful) close of `GF` file handle.

	* font/devpdf/devpdf.am: Tidy up for better build reliability.
	(font/devpdf/util/BuildFoundries): Stop manipulating the
	"download" file.
	(font/devpdf/download): Move the file's comment header from
	here...
	* font/devpdf/download.in: ...to here.
	* font/devpdf/devpdf.am (font/devpdf/download): Use
	"BuildFoundries"'s new `--download` option to construct the
	target from "download.in".  Stop setting write permission on the
	generated download file in the build tree; it's no longer
	necessary.  Stop giving "BuildFoundries" a search path in the
	"font/devps" directory; use "font/devpdf" instead.  This is what
	ultimately angered "make distcheck"; now that make(1) produces
	the "pdf" device's font description files for the default
	foundry (copying them from "font/grops", there's no need for
	"BuildFoundries" to rewrite them, in either directory.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67268>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the report.

2025-07-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/devpdf/util/BuildFoundries.pl: Support new `--download`
	option, taking an input download file as argument and storing it
	to new `downloadFile` scalar.  Default to "download" as before.

	Continues fixing Savannah #67268.

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/devpdf/util/BuildFoundries.pl: Make `--strict` option
	stricter, turning more warnings fatal...
	(LoadFoundry): ...when an embeddable font file is known to be
	unavailable, when a grops(1) font description file is
	unreadable, when afmtodit(1) fails [the inference is
	indirect]...
	(RunAfmtodit): ...when a font description file has an unexpected
	format...
	(UseGropsVersion): ...when a font description file can't be
	created ("copied" with potential modification of relative file
	specifications), when one being read lacks an `internalname`
	directive, and when the file can't be opened for reading.

	Continues fixing Savannah #67268.

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/devpdf/util/BuildFoundries.pl: Throw more

	(UseGropsVersion): ...when trying to open a font description
	file for writing...
	(LoadDownload): ...and when the download file cannot be opened.

2025-07-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[gropdf]: Add `-W` option to make font embedding warnings fatal.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl: Add global scalar
	`makeWarningsFatal`.  Recognize option when calling
	`GetOptions()`.
	(LoadFont): Fall over dead if embedding fails and if
	`makeWarningsFatal` is true.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (usage):

2025-07-01  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	[gropdf] More rational handling of duplicate font entries.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (LoadFont): The primary entry
	has a proper postscript name such as 'iota' whereas
	alternatives tend to have 'uniXXXX' or 'afiiNNNNN'. So
	choose the primary.

2025-07-01  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	[gropdf] Changes for greek glyphs

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (Clean): More permissive re
	to allow for \(+h etc.
	(Loadfont): Cater for (unintentional?) change to afmtodit
	output format by GBR. Handle duplicate font entries more
	sanely - keep first entry and preserve duplicate so it can
	be used with \N'nnn' the same as unnamed ("---") glyphs.
	Not ideal but forced compromise because groff uses decomposed
	unicode names which can lead to duplicate entries.

2025-06-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Add experimental, undocumented global node dumping
	feature.  Except for line numbers and margin characters, this
	essentially produces a graph of the internal representation of
	the entire output--except for line numbers and margin
	characters.  (It's a forest, with one tree per output line.)

	* src/roff/troff/input.h: Declare new global Boolean,
	`want_nodes_dumped`.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Define new global Boolean,
	`want_nodes_dumped`, defaulting false.
	(main): Set it to true if the environment variable
	`GROFF_DUMP_NODES` exists (with any value).
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::do_break): Check the new
	global variable; if it is true and if output is going to the
	top-level diversion, dump the pending output line's node list in
	JSON format (to the standard error stream) just prior to writing
	it as *roff output (to the standard output stream).

2025-06-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

2025-06-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/devpdf/devpdf.am: Refactor.  Make this script
	more Automake-idiomatic (I think) and resemble other groff
	Automake scripts more closely.
	(devpdf_builddir): Define macro.
	(GROFF_FONT_FILES, ENC_FILES, MAP_FILES): Drop macros populated
	by shell command substitution in favor of static file lists...
	(DEVPDFFONTFILES_FROM_DEVPS): ...like this...
	(DEVPDFFONTFILES_FOR_URW) [HAVE_URW_FONTS]: ...and this.
	(DEVPDFFONTFILES): New macro contains only
	`DEVPDFFONTFILES_FROM_DEVPS` plus the "download", "DESC", "SS",
	and "StandardSymSL.pfb" files (all generated by the build, the
	last two trivially).
	(devpdffontdata, devpdffontencdata): Rationalize contents,
	aligning files and macro contents with installation requirements
	so Automake takes care of installing and uninstalling them.
	(MOSTLYCLEANFILES): Add `devpdffontdata`, `devpdffontencdir`,
	`devpdffontmapdir`, so that Automake takes care of cleaning
	them.
	($(DEVPDFFONTFILES_FROM_DEVPS)): New target copies "ps" device's
	font descriptions to build's "pdf" device data directory.
	($(devpdffontencdata)): Now that the "text.enc" encoding file
	name is stored in a macro, use it and compute its basename
	instead of using literals.
	($(DEVPDFFONTFILES_FOR_URW)): Make the "pdf" device's "download"
	file depend on this macro's contents, which may be empty if
	`HAVE_URW_FONTS` is not defined by the "configure" script.
	(font/devpdf/stamp): Respell dependencies using above macros.
	(mostlyclean-local, mostlyclean_devpdf_extra)
	(install-data-local, install_devpdf)
	(uninstall_groffdirs, uninstall_devpdf): Drop targets made
	redundant by better population of `devpdf*data` macros above.

	* font/devpdf/DESC.in: Mount `SS`, `S`, and `ZD` fonts in same

	than to minimize differences between the devices, however the
	"ps" device continues to have a font, `ZDR`, mounted after all
	of the foregoing, that the "pdf" device lacks and does not
	require.

	is a styled glyph often found in text faces.  `*m` is an
	unstyled, but traditionally slanted, lowercase Greek mu used
	overwhelmingly in mathematical or scientific typesetting
	contexts.  It is not appropriate for setting the modern Greek
	language.
	* font/devps/generate/symbol.map:
	* font/devps/generate/text.map: Remove spurious mappings of
	groff's `\[mc]` to PostScript's `mu`.  This prevents afmtodit(1)
	from resurrecting the aforementioned problem, though for
	unrelated reasons we don't regenerate the font description files
	for grops(1) when building groff--we should, someday.  (Among
	other manual changes, we added kerning pairs; see Savannah
	#58897.)
	* font/devps/generate/text.map: Drop all mappings of symbolic/
	mathematical/unstyled Greek special characters `*[A-Za-z]` to
	PostScript glyph names.  As noted above, such mappings are not
	appropriate for text fonts, which (typically) have multiple
	styles available.
	* src/libs/libgroff/uniglyph.cpp (struct S): Delete mappings
	of code points from Unicode Greek and Coptic block
	{U+0370..U+03FF} to *roff's special character identifiers for
	"technical" use of classical Greek; see above.

	[pfbtops]: Add test for `pfbtops` command.

	* src/util/pfbtops/tests/smoke-test.sh: Do it.
	* src/util/pfbtops/pfbtops.am (pfbtops_TESTS): Run test.
	(TESTS): Add test to suite.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Ship test in distribution archive.

2025-06-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl (interpret_line): Recognize new `pfp`
	and `pftr` request names.

2025-06-28  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	* font/devpdf/generate/StandardSymSL.sfd: Adjust glyph positions
	within cell to match grops rendering.
	* font/devpdf/StandardSymSL.pfb: Regenerate from changes above.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67234>.

2025-06-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/devpdf/generate/StandardSymSL.sfd: Add human-readable
	source format for new font.  Everything in groff is available
	under the GNU GPL, so we should provide a "preferred form for
	modification".  (We already do so for "freeeuro.sfd".)
	* font/devpdf/devpdf.am (EXTRA_DIST): ...and ship it in the
	distribution archive.  At this time, we also ship the "compiled"
	PFB file; the build process does not perform any transformation
	of the source SFD file.  That can change in the future if we can
	tolerate a build-time dependency on fontforge(1).

2025-06-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (composite_glyph_name)
	(charinfo_to_node_list): Reform terminology in diagnostic
	messages.  Use the term "character" when dealing with input;
	it's up to the output driver to elicit "glyphs" from a device.
	(charinfo_to_node_list): Refer to "special", not "composite",
	characters, when processing a user-defined character with a
	string iterator.

2025-06-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/preconv/preconv.cpp (do_file): Tweak diagnostic

	Continues the long process of fixing Savannah #66519.

2025-06-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	modules.
	  stdbool-c99 -> stdbool-h-c99
	  stdckdint   -> stdckdint-h
	  stdint      -> stdint-h

	Funk for the report.

2025-06-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: Fix inaccurately reported revision date of groff_man(7)
	and groff_man_style(7) man pages.  Since they're generated by m4
	from a common `.in` file, our Perl `mdate` script was replacing
	the center footer with, effectively, the build time of the
	m4-generated document rather then the revision date of the
	maintained source file.

	* tmac/groff_man.7.man.in: Replace `@MDATE@` with newly
	contrived substitutum [dog Latin], `REVISION_DATE`.  It works
	just like the former, but has a new name to reflect the
	distinguishable process of its replacement.
	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac/groff_man.7.man)
	(tmac/groff_man_style.7.man): Make m4(1) write to a temporary
	file, then process the temporary file with `mdate.pl` to replace
	the aforementioned subtitutum.  As a side effect, there is no
	longer an `@MDATE@` in the file for the ".man" suffix rule in
	"Makefile.am" to affect.

2025-06-21  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	Remove unneccessary call to pdf parser.

2025-06-21  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	Saner ordering of perl switch statement.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (do_X): handle pdfmark commands
	first.

2025-06-20  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	[devpdf, gropdf]: Add `SS` slanted-symbol font support.  Replace
	pseudo-slanted characters with a real font, improving typography
	of, e.g., slanted lowercase Greek letters as used in eqn(1).

	* font/devpdf/DESC.in: Mount new font `SS` prior to `S`.
	* font/devpdf/SS: New file describes new slanted-symbol font.
	The metrics are hand-tweaked.  We can't run afmtodit on the
	symbolsl.afm file in grops because it produces incorrect
	metrics--the width/height values do not take into account the
	rescaling of the glyph sizes by .89.
	* font/devpdf/StandardSymSL.pfb: New PostScript font supplies
	slanted versions of glyphs in the standard Symbol font.
	* font/devpdf/devpdf.am (GROFF_FONT_FILES): Update macro
	definition to scan the build directory for file names matching
	font descriptions, excluding both symbol fonts.  Relocate
	definition to be closer to use.
	(devpdffont_DATA): Add new files "SS", "StandardSymSL.pfb", and
	"download.in".
	(font/devpdf/SS): New target is generated by copying from source
	tree to build tree if they differ.  As a side effect, also copy
	"StandardSymSL.pfb".
	(font/devpdf/util/BuildFoundries): Copy "download.in" file from
	source tree to build tree with new name "download".
	(font/devpdf/download): Set write permission on the target to
	work around GNU Automake "distcheck" feature that makes
	make(1)-generated files read-only; however we want
	"BuildFoundries" to rewrite the file in place.
	(mostlyclean_devpdf_extra): Clean the new files "SS" and
	"StandardSymSL.pfb", as well as "S" since the new regex used to
	populate the `GROFF_FONT_FILES` now overlooks it.
	(install_devpdf, uninstall_devpdf): Explicitly handle "S" font
	description file since the new regex used to populate the
	`GROFF_FONT_FILES` now overlooks it.
	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl: Support multiple specifications
	of `-F` option, populating new list `fdlist`.  Use the runtime
	path separator to populate scalar `fd` if `fdlist` is not a
	singleton.
	* tmac/pdf.tmac: Drop all 28 calls of `pdf:SS` macro for 24
	lowercase Greek letters and 4 variant forms; the slanted-symbol
	font now supplies these.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65098>.

2025-06-16  Dave Kemper <saint.snit@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (distribute_space): Fix expression
	involving C++ `static_cast<>` operator to stop permitting
	integer division within, leading to undesired loss of precision
	when reporting the amount of "spread" applied when performing
	adjustment, as configured by the `spreadwarn` request.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67218>.  [Problem
	introduced by me in commit 8b6ccbce48, 13 May.  --GBR]

2025-06-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tests/an-ext_SY-and-YS-work.sh: Use printf(1), not
	echo(1), when an argument contains backslashes.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper and Deri James for reporting test failures arising from
	the non-portability of backslash usage in echo(1) arguments,
	which frustratingly did not create problems on any systems
	readily available to me.

	Problem introduced by me in commit 4bdcefea1d, 6 June.

2025-06-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/devutf8/devutf8.am (DEVUTF8FONTS): Tweak ordering of
	mounted CJK faces in "DESC" file generated for "utf8" output
	device.  Consistently arrange the Hei (~serif) faces before the
	Song (~sans-serif) ones.

2025-06-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/grohtml/post-html.cpp (html_printer::set_style):

2025-06-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (charinfo::dump): Fix thinko when
	initializing static `char` array literals.  `none` requires only
	one null terminator.  Append one to `comma`.

2025-06-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	parameter a name when it's unused.

2024-11-19  Duncan Losin <dlosin@protonmail.com>

	[pic]: Extend to allow drawing arbitrary polygons.

	* src/preproc/pic/lex.cpp (get_token_after_dot): Add new checks
	for `.v[er[tex]]` and `.p[oint]` syntax for polygons.

	* src/preproc/pic/object.h (enum object_type, object_type)
	(object_type_name):
	* src/preproc/pic/lex.cpp (lookup_keyword): Add `polygon`
	keyword and object type.

	* src/preproc/pic/object.h (struct object): Declare new virtual
	functions for determining polygon vertices and edge midpoints.

	* src/preproc/pic/object.h (class path): Add new `vertex_number`
	and `is_edge` member variables to determine what position should
	be accessed.

	* src/preproc/pic/pic.ypp (tokens): Add new tokens `POLYGON`,
	`DOT_P`, and `DOT_V`.

	* src/preproc/pic/pic.ypp (object_spec): Add new rule `POLYGON`
	to create new object_spec of type `POLYGON_OBJECT`.  Add new
	rule `object_spec WITH vertex` to locate polygons.

	* src/preproc/pic/pic.ypp (place): Add new rules `label vertex`
	and `vertex OF label` to locate polygons.

	* src/preproc/pic/pic.ypp (vertex):
	* src/preproc/pic/object.h (struct vertex): Define new `vertex`
	structure and grammar rule for describing polygon vertices and
	edge midpoints.

	(object::set_vertex_number): Define default behavior for new
	functions.

	* src/preproc/pic/object.cpp (object_spec::object_spec): Set

	* src/preproc/pic/object.cpp (object_spec::make_line): Modify
	line segment array from n-1 to n segments if a polygon has been
	requested.  Create offsets for positioning new polygons.

	* src/preproc/pic/object.cpp (object_spec::make_object): Add
	check for the `POLYGON_OBJECT` object type.

	* doc/pic.ms:
	* src/preproc/pic/pic.1.man (Other changes): Document it.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66458>.

2025-06-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (is_char_usable_as_delimiter): Loosen
	the choke on prohibited delimiters.  To eliminate syntactic
	ambiguity in conditional expressions, we need only reject
	characters that can _begin_ numeric expressions; those in the
	set '/*%<>=&:)' cannot, so permit them as delimiters once more.
	(do_overstrike, do_bracket, do_name_test, do_zero_width_output)
	(read_size, do_register, do_width, do_device_extension)
	(read_drawing_command): Clarify warning diagnostic accordingly.

2025-06-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-ext.tmac (SY): The single-argument form of `SY` need
	not set an ubreakable space and output line continuation escape
	sequence after formatting the argument.  That distinction is in
	fact the whole point of accepting a second argument (a new
	post-1.23 feature), which is set in bold like the first.  (It is
	why you would write `.SY foo bar` rather than `.SY "foo bar".)
	* tmac/groff_man.7.man.in (Synopsis macros) <SY>: Document this
	fact.

	Fixes a regression from groff 1.23.0.  Thanks to Alex Colomar
	for the report.

2025-06-05  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/grohtml/post-html.cpp: Rename `none` enumeration

2025-06-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (mount_font_no_translate): Rename
	argument from `external_name` to `filename` for clarity.  This

	which is usually also the font identifier in GNU troff (but can
	differ if the `fp` request's three-argument form is used).
	(mount_font_at_position): Rename local variable `external_name`

2025-06-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff, troff]: Refactor.

	* src/include/font.h (class font): Promote constructor from

	[libgroff]: Trivially refactor `font` class for clarity.  Fonts
	have up to three names in groff: (1) a font description file
	name; (2) a GNU troff identifier used for its selection [and
	often, but not necessarily, the same as (1); see the `fp`
	request]; (3) an "internalname" that serves multiple purposes--
	for some output drivers, it's a file name of an actual digital
	font file, and for others, it's an integer that encodes styling
	properties.  [Item (3) screams for further refactoring.]  It's
	important to know which of these names we're dealing with, so
	eliminate the unqualified term "name" in the API.

	* src/include/font.h (class font): Rename public member function
	`get_name()` to `get_filename()`.  Rename private member
	variable `name` to `filename`.
	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp
	(font::font): Rename constructor argument from `s` to `fn`.
	(font::~font): Delete `filename`, not `name`.
	(font::get_name): Rename this...
	(font::get_filename): ...to this.
	(font::load_font): Rename `s` argument to `fn`.
	(font::get_filename, font::load): Track rename of member
	variable.

	* src/devices/grotty/tty.cpp: Refactor and fix code style nits.
	Convert manifest constant `DEFAULT_COLOR_IDX` from preprocessor
	macro to global variable of type `const int`.
	(tty_printer::put_color): Reorder equality comparisons to avoid
	inadvertent lvalue assignment.  Compute buffer length for
	formatted string using `sizeof()` on string literal representing
	expected output of maximal length.  Drop `static` qualifier from
	same buffer; the buffer's contents do not need to outlive the
	function call, and allocating ~18 bytes from the stack should
	never be a problem.  Convert `sprintf()` call to `snprintf()`
	and save its return value instead of discarding it.  Use
	`assert()` to check for truncation of formatted string.  This
	is merely an `assert()` because we don't expect truncation to
	ever occur in a production environment, because the buffer is
	sized for output of maximal length.

2025-06-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/grotty/tty.cpp (tty_printer::put_color): Fix

	conversion with `sprintf()` with `long` arguments.

2025-05-24  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	* src/devices/grotty/tty.cpp: Add support for devices supporting
	ECMA-48/ISO 6429 SGR 38 and 48 escape sequences for specifying
	24-bit color values in the RGB color space.  Add global Boolean
	variable `want_sgr_truecolor`.
	(class tty_glyph): Promote `back_color_idx` and

	member variables from `schar` (signed char) to `long`.  Promote
	return value of `color_to_idx()` member function from
	pointer-to-`schar` to pointer-to-`long`.  Promote fourth
	argument of `has_color()` member function from
	pointer-to-`schar` to pointer-to-`long`.  Promote first argument
	of `put_color()` member function from `schar` to `long`.
	(tty_printer::has_color): Promote `idx` argument from
	pointer-to-`schar` to pointer-to-`long`.  Guard existing
	color-definition logic behind test of `want_sgr_truecolor` for
	falsity; otherwise, compute `idx` using bitwise shifts and
	addition.
	(tty_printer::tty_printer): Promote `dummy` local variable
	from `schar` to `long`.
	(tty_printer::color_to_idx): Promote return value from
	pointer-to-`schar` to pointer-to-`long`.  Promote `idx` local
	variable from `schar` to `long`.
	(tty_printer::put_color): Promote `color_index` argument from
	`schar` to `long`.  Guard existing SGR color escape sequence
	emission logic (which uses SGR 30-37 and 40-47) behind test of
	`want_sgr_truecolor` for falsity; otherwise, emit SGR 38 and 48
	sequences.
	(main): Recognize new `-t` option to select use of SGR 38 and 48
	escape sequences.  If specified, configure `want_sgr_truecolor`
	as true.
	* src/devices/grotty/grotty.1.man (Synopsis, Description)
	(Options):
	* src/devices/grotty/tty.cpp (usage): Document new `-t` option.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::next): Drop unnecessary

2025-06-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::next): Replace most of the

2025-06-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::next): Drop dead code from
	`\f` and `\F` escape sequence handlers;
	`read_escape_parameter()` never returns a null pointer.  (It can
	return `NULL_SYMBOL`, but that is an object with an address.)

2025-06-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Refactor, moving font selection logic into a dedicated

	* src/roff/troff/env.h: Give new `select_font()` function
	external linkage.
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (select_font_request): Move bulk of
	logic from here...
	(select_font): ...to here.  Also recognize an empty symbol, in
	addition to a null one, as equivalent to `.ft P`, to accommodate
	what the `\f` escape sequence handler will pass as an argument.

	[troff]: Trivially refactor, continuing naming reform of

	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (do_divert): Fix code style nit.
	Assign Boolean, not integer, literal, to variable of type
	`bool`.

2025-05-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Fix Savannah #67139.  Make diversion objects track
	whether they're "boxed" diversions; GNU troff does not deal
	gracefully with opening a diversion as the regular kind but
	trying to close it as a boxed one.

	* src/roff/troff/div.h (class diversion): Add public member
	variable `is_box`.  Add Boolean argument to constructor with
	default value of `false`.
	(class macro_diversion): Add Boolean argument to constructor.
	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (diversion::diversion): Constructor now
	takes `boxing` Boolean argument and sets `is_box` from it in the
	initializer list.
	(do_divert): Throw error diagnostics and ignore diversion
	closure attempt if the request mismatches the box property of
	the current diversion.  It's a plain error in the `.box foo,
	.di` case and a fatal one in `.di foo, .box` because (only) the
	latter causes invalid memory access.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67139>.  Thanks to an
	anonymous submitter for the report.  Problem reproducible with
	groff 1.22.3 (2014), and appears to date back at least to commit
	dc3c168c3b, 10 October 2004.  Another guess would be the
	introduction of box diversions in groff 1.17 (2001).

2025-05-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[groff]: Regression-test Savannah #67139 (attempted closure of a

	access).

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp: Add `const` qualifier to `char

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Trivially refactor.  Give the

	it can be passed to a template function C++98-conformantly.
	Preprocessor-include "lib.h" so we can use `array_length()`.

2025-05-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Use an _unsigned_ `int` to handle
	the warning mask.  An unsigned type is more idiomatic for bit
	vectors like this.  Update type of `warning_mask`, and its type
	in the `warning_table` structure of anonymous type.  We still
	can't (or shouldn't) use the most significant bit, because all
	*roff arithmetic is signed.  That problem is still 11 warning
	categories away (not counting bit 4, temporarily unused).
	(lookup_warning): Add `unsigned` to return type.
	(lookup_warning, warning, output_warning): Use `0U` literal in
	assignments and comparisons to `unsigned int` objects, and in
	return values instead of `0`.
	(enable_warning, disable_warning): Add `unsigned` to type of
	local variable `mask`.  Explicitly compare value of integral
	type to integral literal instead of letting it pun down to a
	Boolean.
	(do_expr_test): Add `unsigned` to type of local variable
	`saved_warning_mask`.
	(init_input_requests): Create `.warn` built-in register as
	object of type `readonly_mask_register` instead of
	`readonly_register`, since the storage backing it is of unsigned
	integral type.

2025-05-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	control character `\` (which fails unless the user has already
	changed the escape character).  Make it `.` instead, as
	documented.
	(assign_no_break_control_character): Fix bug when `c2` request

	[groff]: Fix Savannah #67133; fail when piped command gets a
	SIGPIPE signal.

	* src/roff/groff/pipeline.c (run_pipeline) [!_WIN32 &&
	!__MSDOS__ && !_UWIN && !__CYGWIN__ && !__EMX__]:
	_Unconditionally_ set bit 2 of the return value in the event of
	_any_ signal hitting a pipelined process.  A workaround that
	James Clark put in for a SunOS 4.1.1 X11-related bug in groff
	1.06 (1992) appears to have led us to grief; if any of the child
	processes in the pipeline being wait(2)ed on was signaled with
	SIGPIPE, this alteration of the return value was not being done.
	If that child was the last in the pipeline (gxditview, the code
	presumes), he walks the list of commands in the pipeline and
	kill(2)s them all with SIGPIPE.  If a process has multiple fatal
	signals pending, which one wins?  Apparently, on Linux 5.10, in
	a fight between SIGPIPE and SIGABRT (raised by abort(3), called
	by assert(3)), SIGPIPE always wins.  So bit 2 of this function's
	return value, which (after a left shift) ultimately becomes
	groff(1)'s exit status, never got set, and so groff happily
	reported success when it should have screamed hideously of
	failure.  Likely the SunOS 4 workaround should be ripped out
	entirely, but this fix adequately detects grohtml failures.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67133>.  Problem appears
	to date back to groff 1.06 (1992).

	Make build more sensitive to failure of HTML output.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (real_output_file::on)
	(real_output_file::off): Add `assert()`ions of complementary
	Boolean state before unconditionally assigning the other.
	One of them fails, in a quiet and underhanded way, when using
	grohtml to format "doc/pic.ms", which scandalously doesn't
	provoke a build failure.  No automated tests trip it, either.  A
	document in the wild could conceivably trip either.  If one
	does, we want to hear about it, preferably with a core file
	generated by an unstripped troff executable.

	member function `is_on()` from `int` to `bool`.  Drop annotation
	of three-valued status; that unfortunate fact applies only to

	styles, or mounting positions), rather than arbitrary *roff
	syntax.  This undocumented customization feature is analogous to
	one in 4.4BSD mdoc(7) but has no counterpart in mandoc(1).

	This change also makes groff mdoc's (complex) internal logic
	easier to follow in the `Nm`, `Pa`, `doc-bullet-list`,
	`doc-dash-list`, `Xr`, `Ot`, `doc-do-func`, `Fn`, `Fo`, `Rv`,
	`doc-header`, and `doc-footer` macro definitions.

	* tmac/mdoc/doc-ditroff:
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-nroff: Update default definitions of
	`doc-*-font` strings to omit font selection escape sequence,
	leaving only font names or string interpolations like `\*[MF]`
	and `\*[HF]` that are themselves specified as naming fonts.

	* tmac/doc.tmac (Fl, doc-generic-macro, Ar, Cd, Fd, In, Nm, Pa)
	(Tn, Bf, Bd, doc-bullet-list, doc-dash-list, doc-diag-list, Xr)
	(Vt, Ft, Ot, Fa, doc-do-func, Fn, Fo, %B, %I, %J, %T, Rv, Mt)
	(Lk):
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-common (doc-header, doc-footer, Sh, Ss):
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-nroff (Dl): Bracket interpolations of
	`doc-*-font` strings with font selection escape sequence syntax.

	* NEWS: Add item warning of incompatible change.

2025-05-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/mdoc/doc-syms (Lb): Stop throwing warning if no
	description is available for the argument.  `Lb` usage is not
	universal among mdoc(7) documents; per Ingo Schwarze, FreeBSD
	and NetBSD use it, but OpenBSD does not.  (And in my opinion,
	maintaining a central registry for library descriptions is not
	tractable.)

	Bower for the report.

	[troff]: Slightly refactor (boolify).

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (struct node):
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (node::interpret): Demote return type

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (class non_interpreted_char_node)

2025-04-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Slightly refactor.

	* src/roff/troff/env.h (get_bold): Rename this declaration...
	(get_emboldening_offset): ...to this.  Change return type from
	`int` to `hunits`.
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (get_bold):
	(get_emboldening_offset): Same for definition.
	(init_env_requests): Wire up `.b` register to
	`get_emboldening_offset()` using `init_hunits_env_reg()` instead
	of `init_int_env_reg()`.

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (get_bold_fontno): Rename this
	declaration...
	(env_font_emboldening_offset): ...to this, because it doesn't
	return a "fontno" (mounting position) at all.  Change return
	type from `int` to `hunits`.

2025-04-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (embolden_font): Add diagnostics.
	Throw error when input attempts to apply emboldening request to
	syntactically invalid object (e.g., ".bd \N'12'" or ".bd 1
	\N'12'").  Add new Boolean local variable
	`emboldening_may_be_conditional` to improve diagnostics when the
	argument count makes the request ambiguous.  Throw warning if
	we're ignoring the third argument because the first two were
	interpreted as a mounting position and emboldening amount,
	respectively.  As annotated in comments, 'Does ".bd 1 2" mean
	"embolden font position 1 by 2 units" (really one unit), or
	"stop conditionally emboldening font 2 when font 1 is
	selected"?'  Also parenthesize complex expression.

2025-04-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[groff]: Add unit test for `bd` request.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/bd-request-works.sh: Do it.
	* src/roff/groff/groff.am (groff_TESTS): Run test.

2025-04-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (font_lookup_info): Improve diagnostic
	message.  When complaining, for example, that a font can't be
	loaded because its mounting position was unresolvable, don't
	report a mounting position of "-1" in the message.  That's an
	internal sentinel value and meaningless to the user.

2025-04-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Fix Savannah #67038.

	* src/roff/troff/node.h: Declare `get_bold_fontno` as taking a
	new first argument, a pointer to an `environment`.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (get_bold_font): Likewise with
	definition, and resolve the environment's currently selected
	font so that we report the correct emboldening amount even if an
	abstract style is the current font selection.  Like
	`env_get_zoom()`, use a temporary variable to avoid yard-long
	expression.  This behavior comports better with DWB and Heirloom
	Doctools troffs.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?67038>.  Problem appears
	to date back to groff's birth.

2025-04-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

2025-04-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp: Trivially refactor, continuing naming
	reform of functions that advance the input stream pointer to use
	the verb "read" instead of "get" or "has", which are more
	general, and can refer to accessor functions that don't mutate
	the state of the formatter.

	return value of member function that is called invariantly.

2025-04-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Slightly refactor.  Boolify and rename
	`is_good_fontno()` to `is_valid_font_mounting_position()`, and
	use it in more places instead of complex expressions meaning the
	same thing.

	* src/roff/troff/node.h: Update declaration.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp: Update definition, and define earlier
	to avoid necessity of forward declaration.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::set_font)
	(environment::environment): Update call sites.

	(env_narrow_space_width): Add call sites, replacing complex
	expressions.

2025-04-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Slightly refactor.  Use a manifest constant for
	failures to look up a font.  Aping libc-style, `errno`-using
	functions conceals more than it reveals here since we have no
	analog to `errno`.  (`errno` was a blind alley anyway, being as
	reentrant and concurrency-friendly as a global lock, but worse
	because it led to indeterminate program states instead of
	slow-but-correct operation.  Option types, error-storing
	function parameters, and exceptions are all better solutions.)

	* src/roff/troff/node.h: Declare `FONT_NOT_MOUNTED`.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp: Define it.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (font_lookup_info::font_lookup_info)
	(troff_output_file::really_begin_page)

	(font_family::font_family)
	(font_family::resolve)
	(font_family::invalidate_fontno)
	(has_font)
	(symbol_fontno): Use it instead of a `-1` literal.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::set_font)
	(environment::set_family)
	(environment::environment): Determine font lookup failure by
	explicit comparison to `FONT_NOT_MOUNTED` instead of checking
	for any negative value.
	(font_family::resolve): Add assertion to spit up if caller tries
	to smuggle us a nonsense mounting position.

2025-04-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (env_definite_font): Rename this...

2025-04-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.  Rename

	better align internal naming practices with our documentation.

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (class font_family): Do it.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (font_family::make_definite): Rename

	[troff]: Fix code style nits.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_suppress): Drop unnecessary cast
	of `0` when performing null pointer comparison.  "A constant
	expression ... that evaluates to 0 can be implicitly converted
	to any pointer or pointer to member type." (_The C++ Programming
	Language, Special Edition_, Stroustrup, 1997, p. 835).

	(env_narrow_space_width): Reorder equality comparisons to avoid
	inadvertent lvalue assignment.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_suppress): ...and apply
	DeMorgan's Law to the same end.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (device_extension_node::tprint):
	Invert sense of and reorder `if` statement to (1) avoid
	inadvertent lvalue assignment and (2) execute the common case
	first, for the human reader's benefit as well as a gesture at
	assisting branch prediction.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp: Initialize global `last_position` of
	type `char` to a meaningful default.  This datum should be of an
	`enum` type, but enum types in C and C++ prior to C++11 were

2025-04-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Tidy up `grostream` type definition.
	(class grostream): Convert (back) from this...
	(struct grostream): ...to this, since all its members are public
	anyway.  Also drop `public` access specifier from `object` base
	class since we require no visibility of its members.  Also mark
	member variables as `const` since they should be immutable after
	construction.

2025-04-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Refactor `grostream` class for
	memory safety.
	(struct grosteam): Convert from this...
	(class grostream): ...to this, inheriting from class `object` so
	that it casts less dangerously thence and thither when stashing
	`grostream`s into and retrieving them from `object_dictionary`
	objects.
	(class grostream): Also re-type `filename` and `mode` member
	variables from (groff) `string` to `symbol`, since they won't
	have embedded null characters (and take up half as much space;
	`sizeof (string)` is 16 on GNU/Linux amd64 whereas that of
	`symbol` is 8).  Making this change by itself exposed memory
	corruption problems, resolved by resituating `grostream` in the
	class hierarchy.
	(grostream::grostream): Drop now unnecessary explicit null
	termination.  That property is implied by the `symbol` class.
	(open_file): Make newly created object anonymous, and drop
	frightening C-style typecast.  Now a `grostream` casts safely
	and implicitly to and from `object`.

	Problem likely introduced by me in commit 6d32f2492, 24
	September, but it was latent (requiring the `symbol` change
	noted above), and without JSON dumpers for `string` and `symbol`
	objects, visibility into memory mischief was limited if it
	didn't cause a SEGV on a developer's machine.

2025-04-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	"Using the test script in Mantis bug 1915 we have observed four

	* Makefile.am: Drop comments documenting `PAGE` and
	`GHOSTSCRIPT` as appearing in "config.h".  Neither appears there
	because they are `AC_SUBST()`ed (into generated Make files), not
	`AC_DEFINE()`d (in "config.h").  Further, the Ghostscript-
	related macro that we expand is named `ALT_GHOSTSCRIPT_PROGS`,
	not `GHOSTSCRIPT`.  Prompted by a report and proposed patch by

2025-04-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::possibly_break_line): Fix
	build error with GCC 5.5 on Solaris 10.  Introduce a temporary
	variable `dsd` to store `space_deficit` as a `double`, and use
	it in divisions when computing the size of overset or underset
	reported in diagnostics.  Use `fabs()` instead of `abs()`.

2025-04-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::possibly_break_line):
	Improve "break" warning diagnostic messages when adjustment is
	frustrated.  In troff mode, use the scaling unit configured by
	the `warnscale` request.  In nroff mode, use ens (which, since
	they are defined in a typeface-proportional manner, are not an
	acceptable scaling unit for `warnscale`).

	* doc/groff.texi.in (Warnings):
	* src/roff/troff/troff.1.man (Warnings): Document it.

	* NEWS: Update item regarding output warnings in nroff mode.

2025-04-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Refactor break/adjustment warning production.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::choose_breakpoint): Stop
	throwing break warnings here...

2025-04-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

2025-04-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Slightly refactor to clarify adjustment logic in
	difficult cases.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (distribute_space): Promote return type
	from `void` to `bool`, communicating whether this function
	successfully adjusted spaces.  Add/update `return` statements.
	(environment::possibly_break_line): Populate `output_width`
	variable in stages, adding `extra_space` only if the
	`distribute_space()` call was successful.  Annotate early
	return scenario for comprehensibility.
	(environment::wrap_up_field): Cast return value of
	`distribute_space()` to `void`; since that's what was happening
	implicitly before, this is a trivial type-correctness change.

	This change might finally solve the mystery of Savannah #44018.

2025-04-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::possibly_break_line):
	Trivially refactor.  Lift computation that is performed in 3 of
	6 cases into a variable, `space_deficit`, whose value is
	computed unconditionally.  (It's an integer subtraction--not too
	spendy.)  Rename `extra_space_width` to `extra_space`.  Simplify
	expressions and annotate logic.

2025-04-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/tests/\

2025-04-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (macro::json_dump): Always print a

	precedes it.  Fixes malformed output of `.pm .T`.

2025-04-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (print_macros): Fix infloop when

	20 March.

2025-04-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (file_iterator::set_location)
	(next_file, line_file, do_source, open_file, copy_file)
	(transparent_file, do_macro_source): Stop freeing memory
	dynamically allocated to store file names encountered in (and
	copied from) the input document.  *roff is a powerful enough
	language that the lifetimes of these file name strings are
	highly variable, and moreover their pointers tend to get copied
	into internal data structures.  Overly aggressive freeing can
	cause garbage to appear in lieu of file names in backtrace
	reports, dumped macros, and so forth.  Add comments musing about
	a future approach to management of this storage.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66981>.

	[troff]: Slightly refactor and fix code style nits.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (file_iterator::backtrace)

	(string_iterator::backtrace): Explicitly compare values of
	pointer type to null pointer literals instead of letting them
	pun down to Booleans.  Parenthesize (formally) complex
	expressions.  Always terminate backtrace message with newline if
	anything at all was written.
	(lookup_color): Reorder equality comparison to avoid inadvertent
	lvalue assignment.

2025-04-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (macro::json_dump): Add more
	information when dumping a macro (or diversion or string):
	report name of file where it's defined if this information is
	available.  Also report line number and length.  Also favor
	`errprint()` over `fputs()`.

2025-04-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (file_iterator::get_location): This
	`bool`-returning function always returned true.  Return `false`
	if no file name information is available; one should always be
	available, and the line number is meaningless without a file
	name (we handle the standard input stream specially, and it
	_has_ a file name for our purposes).

2025-04-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/string.cpp (string::json_extract):
	* src/libs/libgroff/symbol.cpp (symbol::json_extract): Since we
	return a pointer-to-const-char, null-terminate what we hand
	back.  Impedance matching (or, more precisely, conversion)
	between C strings and groff strings is just too hard otherwise.

2025-03-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/nroff/tests/verbose-option-works.sh: Indirect
	invocation of "nroff" command through a shell variable to ensure
	that we test the one that has been built, not one in the $PATH.
	Most other groff automated tests already work this way.  Also
	check for POSIX-non-comforming shell, and skip test if a
	conforming one doesn't seem to be present.

2025-03-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[nroff]: Now that our "configure" script searches for a shell
	that is at least minimally competent, and has an Automake macro
	to expand its name, use it in the "nroff" shell script.  This
	change doesn't obviate the need for run-time checks for features
	that we rely upon but which buggy shells mis-implement; we
	_search_ for a good shell, but an unsatisfactory "/bin/sh" might
	be all we find.  Also, we don't rely on the semantics of an
	empty interpreter name (`#!` followed by a newline), because
	some of our scripts need to invoke a subshell by name: 'test `sh
	-c "echo foo"` && status=good' works; 'test ` -c "echo foo"` &&
	status=good' does not.

	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.sh: Update shebang line to use macro.
	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.am (nroff): Perform macro substitution.

2025-03-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_PROG_SH): Search more aggressively for
	Bourne/Korn-style shells that stand a better chance of being
	POSIX-conforming in ways we require than, oh, say, Solaris 10
	/bin/sh.  Search for bash, ksh, dash, and ash in that order.
	If none are found, use /bin/sh anyway and surrender to our
	run-time fate.

2025-03-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::next): Drop warning
	diagnostic.  DWB troff accepts a negative argument to the `\N`
	escape sequence; so should we.  (Interestingly, it seems to be
	difficult or impossible to get Heirloom Doctools to emit a
	"trout" `N` command--some table maps negative character indices
	to special character names.  For instance, we expect `N-1` but
	get `Chy`.  If no mapping exists for `\N`'s argument, it emits
	_no_ trout command for the character.)

2025-03-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_PROG_SH_IS_POSIX_8_CONFORMING): Rename
	this...

	other than POSIX Issue 8 conformance.
	* configure.ac: Track rename.

2025-03-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::possibly_break_line):
	Supply more information in "cannot adjust line" diagnostic;
	since we now have two others of this form that warn when an
	output line (1) has no adjustable spaces or (2) oversets, in
	this case disclose that it's (3) underset, and say by how much.

2025-03-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_PROG_TEST_SUPPORTS_EF_OPTION): Force
	Autoconf to test "/bin/sh", not a more capable and more

	need to know whether to update our script programs' declared
	shell interpreter.

2025-03-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_PROG_SH_IS_POSIX_8_CONFORMING): Add
	`AC_REQUIRE` on `GROFF_PROG_TEST_SUPPORTS_EF_OPTION`, because we
	need the shell variable `test_ef_works` to be populated.  Also
	fix latent m4 syntax error.
	* configure.ac: Drop `GROFF_PROG_TEST_SUPPORTS_EF_OPTION`, now
	depended-upon inside "groff.m4".

	remove Unicode-style annotation ("U+XXXX").  While accurate if
	"latin1.tmac" is loaded, it can be incorrect if any of

2025-03-22  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::next): Stop throwing an error
	diagnostic and aborting interpretation of a special character
	identifier when it starts with "u" and is of length > 2.  For
	example, `\[unhappy]` is a valid special character
	interpolation, simply not a _Unicode_ special character
	interpolation.  Also solves the same problem when reading
	special character identifiers from font description files.

	[troff]: Warn on failure to adjust the output line.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (distribute_space): I planted an
	`assert()` land mine for myself back in December and it finally
	went off.  Remove assertion that the amount of `desired_space`
	for adjustment must be nonnegative.  While rare, this can in
	fact happen with perverse inputs such as long, unhyphenable
	character sequences or short output line lengths.  Throw new
	warnings in category "break" when adjustment is desired but
	impossible: (1) the output line has no adjustable spaces on it,
	or (2) any adjustable spaces would have to be squeezable/
	shrinkable to achieve a fit, and that is not yet implemented in
	GNU troff (see Savannah #40963).  (Even if/when we do implement
	it, there will be a [likely configurable] limit to how narrow an
	adjustable space can become.)

	* doc/groff.texi.in (Warnings):
	* src/roff/troff/troff.1.man (Warnings): Document additional
	circumstances under which warnings in "break" category are
	thrown.  Clarify existing circumstances.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66932>.

	[troff]: Implement macro/string/diversion dumper.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Do it.  Add inelegant `extern`
	declaration roping in `dump_node_list()` function from
	"node.cpp".
	(class macro_header): Replace `json_dump()` member function with
	`json_dump_macro()` and `json_dump_diversion()`, since how we
	dump depends on what component objects we contain.
	(macro::json_dump): Call appropriate aforementioned function;
	`json_dump_macro` on macros and strings, `json_dump_diversion`
	on diversions.
	(macro_header::json_dump_diversion): Call `dump_node_list()` on
	the `head` member of this object's `node_list` `struct`.
	(macro::json_dump): Rename this...
	(macro::json_dump_macro): ...to this.  Also use `errprint()`
	instead of `fputc()`.
	(print_macros): Check for arguments.  If given any, interpret
	them as macro/string/diversion names and dump the contents of
	each, JSON-encoded.  If not, proceed with previously
	unconditional behavior.

	* doc/groff.texi.in (Debugging) <pm>:
	* man/groff.7.man (Request short reference) <pm>:
	* man/groff_diff.7.man (Other differences): Document it.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp: Trivially refactor.
	(class hyphen_inhibitor_node): Declare member functions in the
	same order as they appear in `struct node`'s declaration; in the

	virtual.
	(hyphen_inhibitor_node::causes_tprint)
	(hyphen_inhibitor_node::is_tag): Define them in the same order,
	too.
	(dbreak_node::add_discretionary_hyphen): Explicitly compare

2025-03-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	local variables of `char` type.

2025-03-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Slightly refactor.  Boolify and rename global and
	local variables, class member functions, and member function
	arguments relating to diversion re-reading and interpreter state
	tracking whether the input stream is being read at the beginning
	of an input line (or the predicate of a certain
	control-structure requests, where ordinary and no-break control

	`int` to `bool`.

2025-03-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (class composite_node): Add
	`dump_node` member function, overriding virtual function in
	`node` (remote) base class.

	(composite_node::dump_node): Disclose more information, namely
	the contents of any defined nodes within.  Because these are
	stored in reverse order--a composite node strongly resembles an
	output line, including a `line_start_node` and tail-first
	ordering--list them in reversed order, putting them forward.

2025-03-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (glyph_to_ucs_codepoint)

2025-03-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/unicode.cpp (valid_unicode_code_sequence):
	Stop writing newline character into error buffer.  It's the
	caller's responsibility to assemble an error message (and
	existing callers do so).  Avoids extraneous newlines on standard
	error stream.

2025-03-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (charinfo::dump): Dump user-defined

	`mac`'s `json_dump()` member function.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (class macro_header): Declare
	`json_dump()` member function.
	(macro::json_dump): New member function calls `macro_header` `p`
	member variable's `json_dump()` member function.
	(macro_header::json_dump): New member function iterates though
	`char_list` `cl` member variable's elements, calling
	`json_encode_char()` on each one.

2025-03-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (class kern_pair_node): Add

	[troff]: Create new `struct container_node` for node types that
	contain a {possibly singleton} list of other nodes.

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (container_node): Do it.  Declare
	constructors mirroring those of `struct node` (but with an extra
	argument for the contained node list); a destructor; and virtual
	member function `dump_node()`, overriding that of `struct node`.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (dump_node_list): New function, a
	counterpart to `copy_node_list()` and `delete_node_list()`,
	walks a singly-linked list of nodes and directs each to dump
	itself.
	(container_node::container_node)
	(container_node::~container_node, container_node::dump_node):
	Define the foregoing.
	(container_node::~container_node): Destructor always calls
	`delete_node_list()` because some node types seem intended to
	contain only one other node, and others a list.  Unifying the
	destruction procedure seems more likely to avoid memory leaks,
	at a cost per destroyed object derived from `container_node`
	of an additional function call and a test of a pointer for
	nullity--but only for objects of classes where this wasn't
	already happening.

2025-03-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	{override} `dump_properties()` for this class.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp
	(diverted_space_node::dump_properties): New member function
	reports value of `vunits` property.

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (class space_node): Specialize
	{override} `dump_properties()` for this class.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (space_node::dump_properties): New
	member function reports value of `hunits` property.

2025-03-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (class charinfo_node): Declare
	member function `dump_properties()` overriding base here...
	(class glyph_node): ...instead of here.
	(composite_node::dump_properties): Rename this...
	(charinfo_node::dump_properties): ...to this (and relocate it to
	live alongside `charinfo_node`'s other member functions).
	(class glyph_node): Undeclare member function `dump_node()`.
	(glyph_node::dump_node): Drop.  The `charinfo_node` base class
	now does everything its derived classes need.

2025-03-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (class composite_node): Rename member
	function `dump_node()` to `dump_properties()`, altering its
	purpose.
	(composite_node::dump_node): Rename this...
	(composite_node::dump_properties): ...to this.  Now we override
	a different function, and can ditch repetitious code that
	reported properties of the base class.

2025-03-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (struct node): Add new virtual member
	function, `dump_properties()`, to support modular composition of
	node dumping.  All nodes have properties, but some dervived
	classes of `node` have _additional_ properties.  Also, we want
	to be able to distinguish property reporting from contained-node
	reporting, which is where recursion comes in.
	(node::dump_properties): Implement it.  This takes over most of
	the former function of `node::dump_node()`...
	(node::dump_node): ...which now just writes out braces `{` `}`
	with properties in between.

2025-03-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (struct node): Undeclare
	`dump_node_list()` virtual function.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (node::dump_node_list): Rename this...
	(dump_node_list): ...to this.  Instead of being a member
	function, it is now an ordinary function taking a
	pointer-to-node as argument.  This is a temporary measure to
	keep node list dumping working.  Stop throwing assertion if the
	given node pointer is null.  Instead, we simply write an empty
	list (`[ ]`).
	* src/roff/troff/env.h (class environment): Rename member
	function `dump_node_list()` to `dump_pending_nodes()`.
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::dump_node_list): Rename
	this...
	(environment::dump_pending_nodes): ...to this.
	(environment:add_char) [0]: Update call sites.
	(environment::dump_node_list): Rename this...
	(environment::dump_pending_nodes): ...to this.  Stop refusing to
	dump a null pointer.  Update call site as above.

2025-03-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Revise `pline` output style.  Use more JSON/YAML-ish
	syntax.  Present node properties in a consistent order: first,
	general node properties (read: member variables of the `node`
	abstract class); next, type-specific properties (read: member
	variables of classes derived from `node`); then, general node
	properties used only by MTSM/grohtml, which I hope one day to
	refactor away.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (glyph_node::dump_node)
	(node::dump_node, node::dump_node_list)
	(composite_node::dump_node, dbreak_node::dump_node): Do it.
	(node::dump_node): Report the `is_special` Boolean property.
	(glyph_node::dump_node, composite_node::dump_node): Write string
	values with JSON-valid escaped characters.

2025-03-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Add `json_length()`, `json_extract()`, and

	* src/libs/libgroff/symbol.cpp (symbol::json_length):
	(symbol::json_extract, symbol::json_dump): Implement them.

2025-03-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Further rationalize header file inclusions.

	* src/libs/libgroff/string.cpp: Include assert.h and string.h.
	Annotate why.

2025-03-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Slightly refactor.

	* src/roff/troff/node.h: Boolify: demote some class member
	variables and member function return types from `int` to `bool`.
	(struct node, class space_node): Update `discardable()`
	declaration.
	(class space_node): Update `set` and `was_escape_colon`
	declarations.
	(class suppress_node): Update `emit_limits` declaration.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (space_node::space_node): Use Boolean
	instead of integer literal in `was_escape_colon` initializer.
	(space_node::spread_space, space_node::freeze_space)
	(space_node::is_escape_colon): Use Boolean instead of integer
	literals when assigning to `bool` member variables.
	(node::discardable, space_node::discardable): Update return
	type.
	(space_node::discardable): Simplify expression.

2025-03-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp:
	* src/roff/troff/node.h: Rename all `ch`, `n` and `list` member
	variables of node classes to `nodes` to later enable insertion
	of a `container_node` abstract class into the inheritance
	structure.  This change throws more light on a pitfall of GNU
	troff's class design; some node classes can contain other nodes
	by using pointers to `node`s, but this is done without recourse
	to any C++ language features to indicate whether such pointers
	are expected to be single elements or lists.  (Compounding the
	ambiguity is that `node` is inherently set up for use as a
	member of a doubly-linked list.)  Thus, this renaming
	unfortunately removes some information about class design
	intentions.  On the other hand, since only programmer knowledge
	and discipline were enforcing the singleton/list distinction
	already, the member variable names were _only_ documentary.  In
	the future, we might want to enhance some of these classes to
	enforce their containment of singleton nodes only.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (hline_node::copy, vline_node::copy)
	(vline_node::width, left_italic_corrected_node::width)

	(left_italic_corrected_node::get_tfont)

	(left_italic_corrected_node::width): Explicitly compare variable
	of pointer type to null pointer literal instead of letting it
	pun down to a Boolean.
	(glyph_node::asciify): Compare local variable of `char` type to
	character rather than integer literal.
	(overstrike_node::add_self): Rename parameter from `nodes` to
	`more_nodes`, since the former now collides with a class member
	variable.
	(space_node::space_node): Initialize member variable of `char`
	type with character rather than integer literal.

2025-03-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (is_valid_term): When warning of an

2025-03-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Add new constructor for `node` type, permitting

2025-03-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (copy_file, transparent_file): Drop
	extraneous `tok.next()` calls; they are already performed just

2025-02-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Make `pnr` request report autoincrement amounts.

	* src/roff/troff/reg.h (class reg): Declare `const` virtual
	functions `get_increment()` and `can_autoincrement()` returning
	`int` and `bool`, respectively.  These exist at the root of the
	register class hierarchy because the `dictionary` class that
	tracks defined registers effectively erases details of their
	types.  (groff doesn't use RTTI anywhere, and doing so seemed
	unnecessary, so I didn't explore it.)
	(class general_reg): Declare non-virtual versions of
	`get_increment()` and `can_autoincrement()`.
	* src/roff/troff/reg.cpp: Include "lib.h" since we now need its
	`INT_DIGITS` symbol.
	(reg::get_increment): Define as returning constant zero.
	(reg::can_autoincrement): Define as returning constant false.
	(general_reg::get_increment): Define.
	(general_reg::can_autoincrement): Define as returning constant
	true.
	(dump_register): If the register can autoincrement, report the
	autoincrement amount, with an explicit sign for clarity and easy
	distinction from the register's value and number format.

	* doc/groff.texi.in (Debugging) <pnr>:
	* man/groff.7.man (Request short reference) <pnr>:

	Implement approximate (`troff -a`) output of zero-width nodes
	{these are constructed from `\Z` escape sequences, and might be

	* src/preproc/preconv/preconv.cpp (do_file):
	* src/preproc/refer/refer.cpp (do_file):
	* src/preproc/tbl/main.cpp (main): Use a consistent pattern when

	Do it.

2025-02-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (class file_iterator): Make class
	manage its own memory for storing file names, instead of reusing
	externally managed pointers (which sometimes refer to statically
	allocated storage, as with "-" representing the standard input
	stream).  De-`const` `filename` member variable.
	(file_iterator::file_iterator): Constructor now uses strdup(3)
	to copy the supplied file name instead of just a pointer to it
	via the initializer list.  (In C++, tastes differ whether a
	constructor should call [non-virtual] member functions.  In this
	case, I don't.)
	(file_iterator::next_file): Call member function
	`set_location()` instead of manipulating member variables, to
	ensure reliable memory management.
	(file_iterator::set_location): Use strdup(3) to allocate storage
	for the file name and use the returned pointer.  If the file
	name pointer is not null, free(3) it first.

2025-02-22  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp: Include "string.h" standard header

2025-02-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Refactor; make *roff character lookup without
	side-effect of creation it more explicit.  (This way it's easier
	to withdraw GNU troff's own `dictionary` class in the future in

	* src/roff/troff/charinfo.h (get_charinfo):
	* src/roff/troff/token.h (get_char):
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (get_charinfo_by_index): Add new

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Use these new facilities.
	(report_character_request): Explicitly prevent creation of each
	character we look up.  Improve diagnostics.  Report information
	about indexed characters (`\N'123'`) more intelligibly.
	(remove_character): Explicitly prevent creation of each
	character we remove.  Intelligibly report nonexistence of
	characters for which removal is attempted.  Throw error when
	attempt is made to remove a non-character, like `\~`.

2025-02-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Add member functions to `token` class to assist with

	has `type` of `TOKEN_CHAR`, `TOKEN_SPECIAL_CHAR`, or
	`TOKEN_INDEXED_CHAR`.
	(token::is_indexed_character): New function returns whether the
	object has `type` of `TOKEN_INDEXED_CHAR`.

	[libgroff]: Validate character indices in font description files
	more rigorously.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load): Do it.  Refer to an

	Check for failure of strtol(3).  Reject indices that are out of
	`int` range.  Thus convinced that a narrowing conversion will be
	value-preserving, use C++ `static_cast` operator instead of

2025-02-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Add experimental charinfo dump feature.

	* src/roff/troff/charinfo.h (class charinfo): Declare `dump()`
	member function, taking and returning no arguments.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (charinfo::dump): Implement it.
	(report_character_request): Add request handler that iterates
	each ordinary or special character in the argument and calls
	`dump()` on it.
	(init_input_requests): Wire up `pchar` request to handler.

2025-02-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (define_character): Refactor and
	annotate.  Declare variables closer to their point of use.
	Reorder conditional branches to put the more common case first.
	Use C++ `static_cast` operator instead of C-style type cast.

2025-02-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Refactor.
	(define_character): Break out character mode description logic
	from here...
	(character_mode_description): ...into this new function, since a
	forthcoming change will also require it.

2025-02-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description): When describing
	special character, include its identifier.

2025-01-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (is_char_usable_as_delimiter):
	Restore `|` character as an invalid delimiter when not in
	compatibility mode.  This would regress the fix for Savannah
	#66481, but...

	(do_overstrike, do_bracket, do_name_test, do_zero_width_output)
	(read_size, do_register, do_width, do_device_extension)
	(read_drawing_command): Throw warning in "delim" category and
	explain ambiguity of delimiter instead of emitting error and
	refusing further interpretation of the escape sequence being
	parsed.  Leave behind "#if"ed code for restoration of former
	stricter behavior in a future groff release (which would fix
	Savannah #66009).

	(is_conditional_expression_true): Stop special-casing an
	exception for `|` that permitted it to be used as a formatted
	output comparison delimiter.  Savannah #66481 complained only
	about groff's rejection of `|` to delimit the argument to the
	`\w` (width measurement) escape sequence, not in general, and
	was seen in some man pages.  The usage Paul Eggert reported
	remains accepted, albeit warned about, per `do_width()` above.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/check-delimiter-validity.sh: Update test
	expectations.  We now expect `|` to be invalid once again to
	delimit a line-drawing escape sequence.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66686>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the report.  Savannah #66526 is implicated.

2025-01-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66723>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the report.  Problem introduced by me in commit
	d2dceabb83, 30 August.

2025-01-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/tests/hys-request-works.sh: Add test.
	* src/roff/groff/groff.am (groff_TESTS): Run test.

2025-01-24  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Slightly refactor.  Use more idiomatic C++ style,
	employing a function overload on the `charinfo` class's
	`set_macro()` member function instead of a separate "extended"
	version `setx_macro()` that takes an additional argument.

	* src/roff/troff/charinfo.h (class charinfo): Do it.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (charinfo::setx_macro): Rename
	this...
	(charinfo::set_macro): ...to this, overloading the name.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (define_character): Update the
	two-argument form's only call site.

2025-01-18  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (define_character_request): Promote
	scope of grammar computation describing the invoking request.
	I'm going to need it for further refactoring of this function
	anticipated to resolve Savannah #66675.

2025-01-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac (m1, m2, m3, m4, ba, ip, @p, 2c, PS): Migrate from
	AT&T troff idiom of applying a default scaling unit
	{unconditionally appending one to a macro argument} to GNU
	troff's, using `do` and the `;` numeric expression operator.
	Since commit 2bd122bf56, 17 August, the old method provokes
	syntax warnings when the user supplies an explicit scaling unit.
	(PS): Convert an existing use of `;` to take place in a `do`
	context to ensure that it works in compatibility mode.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66700>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the report.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (define_font_specific_character)
	(remove_font_specific_character): Recast diagnostic messages.
	"Glyphs" are rendered by fonts; no *roff has a mechanism for
	constructing glyphs per se.  What we're throwing diagnostics
	about here are font-specific fallback character definitions.

2025-01-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Make more requests that take mandatory arguments--

	diagnostics in category "missing" when they aren't given any.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (define_character_request)

	character definitions.
	    `CHAR_FONT_SPECIAL` -> `CHAR_FONT_SPECIFIC_FALLBACK`
	    `CHAR_SPECIAL`      -> `CHAR_SPECIAL_FALLBACK`
	The `char_mode` enumeration type involves the resolution order

2025-01-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (define_character): Improve
	diagnostic message: characterize failing character definition as
	"invalid", not "bad", identify which request is being handled,
	report expected input, and describe input actually received.

2025-01-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (define_character): Fix code style

	pointer literal instead of letting it pun down to a Boolean.

2025-01-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.  Rename character-definition
	request handler functions to end with `_request`, and rename the
	workhorse function to simply `define_character`.  Mark them all
	`static` (except for `define_font_specific_character`, which
	already was) while we're at it.

	Parenthesize complex expressions.

2025-01-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	The mismatch of the year numbers is not a typo.  The official
	name is "ISO/IEC 9899:2024", so the "4" is correct there.

	But as a colloquial name, "C23" is more widespread than "C24",
	probably because __STDC_VERSION__ == 202311L: The final version
	of the standard was ready in 2023, only formally publishing it

	Revamp build-time check of POSIX-conforming test(1) command.

	"test -ef", long depended upon by the contributed program
	gdiffmk(1) for certain functionality, is now standard as of
	POSIX Issue 8 (2024).  The Austin Group's threshold criteria for
	inclusion in the standard mean that such a feature is widely
	available, and one need not pessimistically assume that the Bash
	shell must be used to obtain the feature.  Refactor and revise
	our detection and fallback techniques accordingly.

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_HAVE_TEST_EF_OPTION): Rename this...
	(GROFF_PROG_TEST_SUPPORTS_EF_OPTION): ...to this.  Simplify,
	making it a simple test of the feature, using "sh -c" since we
	don't care whether the shell itself or a 'test' executable in
	the $PATH provides it.
	(GROFF_BASH): Rename this...
	(GROFF_PROG_SH_IS_POSIX_8_CONFORMING): ...to this.  It's a
	mouthful, but reflects our concerns.  We don't care about Bash
	per se (groff does not employ Bashisms); we care about whether
	the shell conforms to POSIX Issue 8.  Rename the `AC_SUBST`ed
	macro `BASH_PROG` to `POSIX_SHELL_PROG`.  If we don't find a
	conforming shell, _then_ fall back to Bash for
	`POSIX_SHELL_PROG`, if it is available; if not, configure-time
	tests are fruitless and programs must perform runtime checks for
	POSIX non-conformance (since we're not shipping our own shell or
	test(1) to close the gap).
	* configure.ac: Update expansion sites of m4 macros to use their
	new names.

2024-12-22  onf <onf@disroot.org>

	Support building without makeinfo(1) installed.

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_PROG_MAKEINFO): Simplify logic to not throw
	error if "groff.info" is older than "groff.texi"; that is now an
	accepted state of affairs during configuration.  (make(1) could
	fail later, though.)  Set new variable `groff_have_makeinfo`.
	Stop `AC_MSG_WARN`-ing if it's absent.
	(GROFF_MAKEINFO_PROGRAM_NOTICE): New macro warns user of the
	consequences of not having (a recent enough) makeinfo(1)
	installed.
	* configure.ac: Set Automake conditional `HAVE_MAKEINFO` if the
	corresponding new shell variable was assigned by
	`GROFF_PROG_MAKEINFO`.  Report in configuration summary whether

	[nroff]: Work around malicious non-compliance with POSIX.

	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.sh: We can use POSIX shell parameter
	expansion only if the shell supports it, but it's a hard feature
	to test for within a shell script because non-conforming shells
	reject it as bad syntax, aborting interpretation of the script.
	Use the error return status of `unset` applied to a nonexistent
	variable as a proxy.  If the shell is thus adjudged as lousy,
	use a cruder method of obtaining the basename of the script, and
	refuse to process option clusters, because we need parameter
	expansion to handle them.
	* src/roff/nroff/tests/verbose_option_works.sh: Skip test if
	the system lacks a grep conforming to POSIX Issue 4 (1994).

2024-12-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (is_conditional_expression_true):

	including DWB 3.3 and Heirloom Doctools.  Problem appears to
	date back to groff 1.02.

	GNU troff has long thrown diagnostics in this context, of
	increasing detail in recent years.  For example:

	troff:mm/0.MT:271: warning: missing closing delimiter in output
	  comparison operator; expected character '|', got a newline

	However, this was easily overlooked in our automated tests
	because it didn't break formatting.

	Rely on gnulib for `unlink()` if necessary.

	* bootstrap.conf: Add "unlink" to `gnulib_modules`.

	* src/libs/libgroff/tmpfile.cpp:
	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp: Include "<unistd.h>" standard
	header file to ensure visibility of `unlink` declaration.  Wrap
	this in `HAVE_UNISTD_H` preprocessor conditional (a symbol we
	direct the user to define in "Makefile.am" if necessary).  I
	think gnulib obviates this, but the idiom is widely used in the
	groff codebase for this header file so I leave an experimental
	scrub-out for another day.  (It would also help to have a good
	communication loop with someone building groff on a non-POSIX
	system like native Windows; I don't have one handy.)

2024-11-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Rely on gnulib for `strsignal()` if necessary.

	* bootstrap.conf: Add "strsignal" to `gnulib_modules`.

	we've got gnulib's replacements.
	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp: Include "<string.h>" standard
	header file to ensure visibility of `strsignal` (and `strerror`)
	declarations.
	* src/roff/groff/pipeline.c: Drop declaration of `xstrsignal`,
	our own replacement for `strsignal`.
	(xstrsignal): Drop.
	(run_pipeline): Update call site.

2024-11-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Rely on gnulib for `strerror()` if necessary.

	* bootstrap.conf: Add "strerror" to `gnulib_modules`.

	need Autoconf's replacement if we've got gnulib's.
	* Makefile.am: Drop mention of function/macro in comment.
	* src/include/lib.h: Drop C preprocessor conditional logic.
	* src/roff/groff/pipeline.c: Drop fallback definition.  Let

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp (scanArguments): Recognize but
	ignore `-k` (rather than `-U`) option.  Also, make the argument

	argument, which can be ambiguous to parse, especially in light
	of groff(1)'s `-P` option.
	* src/devices/grohtml/post-html.cpp (main): Recognize and

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (is_char_usable_as_delimiter):
	Revert fix for bug #66009.  Unfortunately, `|` is in use in the
	wild as a delimiter, for instance in man pages for GNU awk, GNU
	grep, and GNU rcs.  Weaning people off of it (because it is a
	valid character in a numeric expression, and GNU troff has never
	accepted most other such characters as delimiters,{*} whereas
	AT&T troff accepted them all) looks to be a multi-stage,
	multi-year process.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66481>.  Thanks to Paul
	Eggert for the report.

	{*} For distorted values of "most"--both GNU and AT&T troffs
	accept any basic Latin letter (A-Za-z]) as a delimiter, a
	collection of 52 exceptions that quantitatively swallows the
	rule.  Pragmatically, few *roff document authors past or present
	seem to have been adventurous enough to exercise this freedom.

	third argument of Boolean type, `is_utf16le`.
	* src/devices/grops/ps.cpp (ps_output::put_string): Adjust

	UTF-16LE-encoding, and write out 4-digit instead of 2-digit
	hexadecimal numeric literals when that is the case.
	(class ps_printer): Change type of `sbuf` member variable from
	`char` to `uint16_t`.  Change type of third argument to
	`set_subencoding` member function from `unsigned char *` to
	`uint16_t *`.
	(ps_printer::set_subencoding): Rename third argument from
	`codep` to `code`--it's no longer an indirect reference to a
	single `char`, but a 2-element `uint16_t` array.  If the font's
	"internalname" directive contains the substring "-UTF16-",
	populate `code` argument with little-endian 16-bit value.
	(ps_printer::set_char): Declare `code` as above: a 2-element

	`code` using surrogate pairs (`code[1] > 0`).
	(ps_printer::flush_sbuf): Conditionalize form of output on font

	* src/devices/grohtml/post-html.cpp: Declare new constant
	integer objects `CHARSET_ASCII`, `CHARSET_MIXED`, and
	`CHARSET_UTF8` to configure representation of character entities
	in output.
	(main): New option `-U` takes argument configuring the means of
	encoding character entities.  If the argument is `0` or `-`,
	select `CHARSET_ASCII`; if `1`, select `CHARSET_MIXED`, and if
	`2` or `+`, select `CHARSET_UTF8`, which is also the default.
	(to_unicode): Replace this function with...

	`charset_encoding` is not `CHARSET_ASCII`, otherwise a numerical
	character reference.
	(get_html_entity): Return UTF-8 sequence if `charset_encoding`
	is `CHARSET_UTF8`.  Otherise, Return UTF-8 sequence if

	`font_char_metric`.  Declare private member function
	`get_font_wchar_metric()` to access it.
	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (struct font_char_metric): Add
	members `next` (a pointer to the struct's own type) and
	`end_code` of type `int`.
	(glyph_to_ucs_codepoint): New function returns UCS code point
	from a (non-composite) `glyph` object, or -1 if invalid.
	(font::font): Constructor initializes `wch` member variable to
	null pointer.
	(font::~font): Destructor frees storage allocated in
	`font::load()` for `special_device_coding` member of `wcp`
	struct, and that of `wcp` itself.
	(font::contains): If `glyph_to_ucs_codepoint()` returns a valid
	value for the glyph, populate its wide character metrics and
	return true.
	(font::get_font_wchar_metric): New function obtains font metrics
	of input character by Unicode code point.
	(font::get_width, font::get_height, font::get_depth)
	(font::get_italic_correction, font::get_left_italic_correction)

	`glyph_to_ucs_codepoint()` returns a valid value for the glyph,
	populate its wide character metrics and return the appropriate
	parameter based on them.
	(font::get_width): Add conditional guard when computing width
	for a glyph from a "Unicode font"; use the computation only if
	the device description file ("DESC") didn't declare
	"unscaled_charwidths".
	(font::load): Recognize new directive in font description files:
	"charset-range", which works like the existing "charset"
	directive except that the glyph descriptions use a `name` of the
	form "uFFFF..uFFFF" (where "FFFF" is a hexadecimal digit
	sequence), and apply the metrics identically to all glyphs in
	the designated range.
	(font::load): When processing glyph descriptions in "charset"
	section and the device has declared the "unicode" directive,
	stop scaling the width of the glyph by what `wcwidth()` returns
	for it.  (Does this fix Savannah #44018?)

	[troff]: Fix Savannah #64484.  This change restores groff
	1.23.0's handling of characters in `device` request arguments,
	except that {1} special character escape sequences are
	interpreted (except for composite special characters, a planned
	future development) and {2} unprintable character codes such as
	ASCII 2 are no longer emitted in GNU troff output by this means.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (device_request): Refactor and revise
	argument interpretation.  Reconstitute an encoded unbreakable
	space code point as its escape sequence (spelled with the
	default escape character).  Throw warning in category "syntax"
	if a valid but unprintable input character is encountered.
	Throw warning in category "syntax" if an escape sequence other
	than `\[` is encountered.  (A reconstituted `\~` is not warned
	about.)

	* NEWS: Explain changes to `\X` and `.device` argument
	processing.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?63074>.  Thanks to Nikita
	Ivanov for the report.

2024-11-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/grops/psrm.cpp (resource_manager::output_prolog)
	(resource_manager::supply_resource): Migrate from using
	`font::open_file()` to `font::open_resource_file()`, restoring
	grops's ability from groff 1.22.4 and earlier to open arbitrary
	file specifications as PostScript prolog or font files.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66419>.  Thanks to Rob
	Kolstad for the report.

2024-11-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/include/font.h (class font): Declare new
	`open_resource_file()` member function with same interface as
	`open_file()`, but intended to open arbitrary file
	specifications instead of only files within groff's font search
	path.  This is for use by drivers that need to embed auxiliary
	files in their output, such as font files for PostScript
	{contrast these with groff's font _description_ files}.
	* src/libs/libgroff/fontfile.cpp (font::open_resource_file):
	Implement new function.

2024-11-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_CHECK_VERSION_FORMAT): Use a _basic_ (not
	extended) regular expression as the pattern operand to expr(1)'s
	`:` operator.  Should fix configuration failure on macOS.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66438>.  Thanks to Sven
	Schober for the report.

2024-11-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (interpolate_macro, lookup_request):
	Recast warning diagnostic in "mac" category to report that a
	"name", rather than a "macro", is not defined.  While more
	vague, it's also less misleading, since requests, strings, and
	diversions all occupy the same name space and the warning is
	thrown only if no identifier of any of these types exists.

	* doc/groff.texi.in (Dummy Characters): Update example.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66350>.  Thanks to Bjarni
	Gislason for the report.

2024-11-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (lookup_request): Use C++
	`static_cast` operator instead of C-style type cast.  Reorder
	equality comparison to avoid inadvertent lvalue assignment.

2024-11-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_source, do_macro_source):
	Refactor to use `read_string()` instead of `get_long_name()` to
	obtain the argument; this means that the argument consumes the
	rest of the input line instead of being treated as a groff
	identifier.  This change permits spaces in sourced file names.

	* doc/groff.texi.in (I/O) <so, soquiet, mso, msoquiet>
	(Other Differences):
	* man/groff.7.man (Request short reference) <so>:
	* man/groff_diff.7.man (New requests) <mso, msoquiet, soquiet>:
	(Other differences): Document it.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/\
	so-request-accepts-embedded-space-in-arg.sh: Test it.
	* src/roff/groff/groff.am (groff_TESTS): Run test.

	* NEWS: Add item.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66434>.

2024-11-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[soelim]: Read argument to `so` request in a more GNU troff-ish
	fashion (and a more AT&T troff-ish fasion, if one considers the
	`ds` and `as` requests).  Accept but discard a leading double
	quote to permit embedding of leading spaces in the file name,
	and accept unescaped literal spaces in argument.

	* src/preproc/soelim/soelim.cpp (do_so): Do it.
	* src/preproc/soelim/soelim.1.man (Description): Document it.

	* src/preproc/soelim/tests/space-in-argument-works.sh: Add unit
	test.
	* src/preproc/soelim/soelim.am (soelim_TESTS): Run test.

	* NEWS: Add item.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66027>.

2024-11-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[soelim]: Fix code style nits.

	* src/preproc/soelim/soelim.cpp: Boolify and rename some global
	variables.
	    `compatible_flag` -> `want_att_compat`
	    `raw_flag`        -> `want_raw_output`
	    `tex_flag`        -> `want_tex_output`
	(main, set_location, do_file): Track renames.
	(do_so): Boolify and rename local variable, demoting integer
	`success` to Boolean `is_filename_valid`.  Use Boolean literals
	for assignments.
	(do_file): Adjust language of diagnostic message.
	(usage): Expand usage message with an actual description.
	(main): Use standard C library symbols `EXIT_SUCCESS` and
	`EXIT_FAILURE` with `exit()` calls instead of integer literals.
	(main, do_file): Replace `assert(0)` calls with communicative
	predicates.
	(do_file): Check return value of `fclose()`, and exit with fatal
	error if it fails.
	(main): Distinguish `ferror()` status and `fflush(stdout)`
	failures when cleaning up before exit.

2024-11-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Slightly refactor.  Shift responsibility for calling
	`tok.next()` onto callers of `read_string()` instead of doing it
	internally.  For the purpose I have in mind (migrating `so` and
	`mso` to use `read_string()`), the latter advances the input
	stream pointer too early--better to let the caller control that.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_string): Drop `tok.next()`
	call.
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (override_sizes): Add `tok.next()`
	call.

2024-11-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_string): Recognize a leading
	double quote in the argument and handle it like other
	"contents"-reading requests do; the best known of these is the
	string-definition request, `ds`, which however uses its own
	logic.  This change affects only the `pi` and `sy` requests.

2024-11-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Trivially refactor.
	(decode_args): Rename this...
	(decode_macro_call_arguments): ...to this.
	(decode_string_args): ...and this...
	(decode_escape_sequence_arguments): ...to this.
	(macro::invoke, composite_glyph_name, read_request)
	(interpolate_string_with_args): Update call sites.

2024-11-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (decode_args, decode_string_args):
	Boolify and rename local variable, demoting integer
	`done_tab_warning` to Boolean `was_warned`.  Use Boolean
	literals for assignments.

2024-11-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/groff_man.7.man.in (Options) <-rCHECKSTYLE>: Document
	feature introduced in groff 1.23.0.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?62042>.  Thanks to Alex
	Colomar for the report.

2024-11-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (diagnose_invalid_identifier): Avoid
	potentially reporting stale token description in diagnostic
	message, using same technique as commit 1277744e72, 20 August.
	I was unable to verify that the token description really is
	stale, however.  It might not be, since it is lazily computed
	and the class's `description()` member function is not called in
	the interim, but I also could not demonstrate to myself that the
	relevant diagnostic message is reachable.  Use strdup() to copy
	the token description (grabbing ~30 bytes from the heap) and
	free that storage later just in case.

2024-11-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Improve input validation.  Use `has_arg()` (inverted if
	necessary) more often to better distinguish between arguments
	that are truly absent and those for which attempts to read
	"symbol" (identifier) names result in their objects' `is_null()`
	member functions returning true, which happens both for absent
	and for syntactically invalid identifiers.

	* src/roff/troff/reg.cpp (define_register_request)
	(assign_register_format_request, alias_register_request): Remove
	assertions I added in commit 2f6a72b9e3, 3 September, that get
	tripped on invalid input.
	(assign_register_format_request): Skip remainder of input line
	and return early if the first argument is an invalid identifier.
	(remove_register_request): Explicitly break out of loop as soon
	as we run out of arguments.
	(alias_register_request, rename_register_request): Throw warning
	in category "missing" only if second argument is truly missing,
	not if it is invalid; in this scenario, `get_name()` has already
	thrown an error diagnostic.
	(alias_register_request): Check second argument for validity as
	identifier before attempting to look it up in the register
	dictionary.

2024-11-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (add_hyphenation_exceptions):
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (remove_character, read_title_parts)
	(set_hyphenation_codes, report_hyphenation_codes)
	(hyphenation_patterns_file_code): Drop unnecessary `tok.skip()`
	calls before `has_arg()`: the latter advances through spaces if
	needed.

2024-11-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (pipe_source_request): Drop branch
	unreachable since commit 6dee590de8, 12 September.

2024-11-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_request, do_terminal)
	(do_write_request, set_hyphenation_codes)
	(report_hyphenation_codes): Slightly refactor.  Replace
	`!(tok.is_newline() || tok.is_eof())` with `has_arg()`, for
	readability and consistency.

2024-11-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (pipe_source_request): Align wording
	of warning diagnostics with each other.

2024-11-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (file_iterator::file_iterator):
	Boolify and rename third argument, demoting integer `po` to
	Boolean `popened`.  Use Boolean literal for default argument.
	(pipe_source_request): Use Boolean literal at call site.

2024-11-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (has_args): Slightly refactor; use
	the same expression to compute the return value after having
	advanced the input pointer through spaces as is used at the top
	of the function.

2024-11-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Slightly refactor.  Replace `tok.is_newline() || tok.is_eof()`
	with `!has_arg()`, for readability and consistency.

2024-11-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (set_character_flags): Check for
	arguments as the very first thing in the function, before trying
	to read an integer.

2024-11-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Make more requests that take mandatory arguments--
	specifically `pn`, `ti`, `rchar`, and `hpfcode`--throw warning
	diagnostics in category "missing" when they aren't given any.

	Continues commit e9828b2927, 21 October 2023.

2024-11-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/doc-old.tmac ([initialization]): Set `cR` register only
	if not already defined on the command line.  This is so that the
	package's trap locations can be compared with the original from
	4.3BSD-Reno (1990) even in nroff mode.

2024-11-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl (construct_command): Check for
	truthiness of `main_package` scalar before using it in
	comparison, avoiding the emission of Perl warnings.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66429>.  Problem
	introduced by me prior to groff 1.23.0 when I rewrote the tool.

2024-11-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grops]: Further revise fix for Savannah #61424.  Instead of
	checking for a nonpositive `errno` after calling
	`font::open_file()` and assuming that that means the function
	rejected the file name for having a slash character in it, check
	the file name at the call site and throw a fatal error there if
	it contains one.

	* src/devices/grops/ps.cpp (ps_printer::define_encoding):
	* src/devices/grops/psrm.cpp (resource_manager::output_prolog)
	(resource_manager::supply_resource): Do it.

	Begins to address <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66419>.

	* src/devices/grops/psrm.cpp (resource_manager::output_prolog)
	(resource_manager::supply_resource)
	(resource_manager::read_download_file): Align diagnostic message
	wording with recent revisions to GNU troff.

	* src/devices/grops/ps.cpp (ps_printer::define_encoding):
	Substantially improve fatal diagnostic thrown when failing to
	parse a grops encoding file, replacing "bad second field" with
	information a user is more likely to be able to act on.

	Deprecate rather than withdrawing support for AT&T font names,
	on "pdf" and "ps" devices only.

	* tmac/ps.tmac: Restore font translations to groff font names.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp: New global vector
	`deprecated_font_identifiers` stores deprecated AT&T font names.
	Add external declaration of `is_device_ps_or_pdf`.
	(warn_if_font_name_deprecated): New function searches vector for
	given symbol `nm` (a font name); if found, throws a warning in
	category "font" and deletes the name from the vector.
	(environment::set_font): If `is_device_ps_or_pdf`, call
	`warn_if_font_name_deprecated()`.
	(init_env_requests): Populate new vector.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: New global Boolean tracks whether
	the output device is named "pdf" or "ps".  We need this because
	"CW" is a valid, non-deprecated font name on the "dvi" device.
	(main): Once the name of the output device is determined, update

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (font_size::dump_size_list): Fix
	incorrect unit in reported list--it should be "s", not "z":
	these are not scaled/subdivisible points but the subdivided
	units themselves.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/sizes-request-works.sh: Update text
	expectations.

2024-10-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor, renaming the font size "table" to
	the font size "list"; it's not a two-dimensional structure.

	* src/roff/troff/env.h (class font_size): Rename member variable
	`size_table` to `size_list`.  Rename member functions
	`init_size_table()` and `dump_size_table()` to
	`init_size_list()` and `dump_size_list()`.
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp: Update definition, call, and
	derefernce sites in the global scope and...
	(font_size::init_size_list, font_size::dump_size_list):
	(font_size::font_size, override_sizes, environment::print_env):
	...here.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (main): Update call site (setting up
	size list for font used in default environment at startup).
	* src/roff/troff/node.h: Update external declaration.

2024-10-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/sv.tmac: Spell string translations using groff special

	* PROBLEMS: Document macOS/Homebrew/uchardet issue.  Add item
	and document workaround under "groff 1.22.4" because it likely

	December 2018.

	"ChangeLog.old"}, James Clark converted some code in grolj4(1)
	from strtoul(3) to strtol(3), possibly because the function was
	not widespread or standardized.  Presumably that lesson was
	applied here as well.  It's standard now, in ISO C99, for which
	we require compiler support.  Migrate text-to-integer conversion
	and discard diagnosis of negative value.

2024-10-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (table::add_entry): Refactor to
	avoid overreading memory allocated to `string` objects, which
	don't null-terminate their contents.  Use string class's
	existing `search` and new `find` member functions to perform
	character and substring matches, respectively, instead of
	`strchr()` and `strstr()`.  As a side benefit, the code now
	looks cleaner and reads easier.

	Fixes a SEGV reported by Lennart Jablonka that I can't reproduce
	but which made sense once he pointed it out.  Problem introduced
	by me in commit a91cd457d9, 26 September.

2024-10-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/include/stringclass.h (class string): Declare new `find`
	public member function; it works like `search` but takes a
	pointer to `const char`, making it a substring locator.

	* src/libs/libgroff/string.cpp (string::find): Implement it.

2024-10-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* bootstrap.conf: Add "memmem" to `gnulib_modules`.

2024-10-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/include/stringclass.h (class string): Fix code style nit:
	`const`-ify argument to `search` public member function.

	* src/libs/libgroff/string.cpp (string::search): `const`-ify
	argument and local variable.  Use C++ `static_cast` operator
	instead of C-style type cast.  Explicitly compare variable of
	pointer type to null pointer literal instead of letting it pun
	down to a Boolean.  Parenthesize complex expression.

2024-10-05  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/reg.cpp (dump_register): Remove garbage from
	`errprint()` format string.

2024-10-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (table::init_output): Migrate to use
	of `.R` register for a huge value in generated groff language,
	instead of hard-coding (2^31)-1 as a numeric literal.

2024-10-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp: Add C preprocessor macro storing
	the name of a groff register for saving the state of line
	numering enablement.
	(table::init_output): Save the value of the `.nm` register to
	this groff register.
	(table::do_bottom): Test the value of that register (instead of
	the saved line number itself) when deciding whether to reënable
	line numbering after leaving the table region.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66290>.  Problem
	introduced by me in commit 950f92e25f, 28 November 2022, when
	fixing Savannah #61040.  Thanks to Deri James for the report.

2024-10-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (class input_iterator)
	(class string_iterator, class macro_iterator):
	Demote `get_break_flag()` member function from `int` to `bool`.
	Return Boolean, not integer, literal from it.
	(class string_iterator, class macro_iterator): Demote member
	variable `with_break` from `int` to `bool`.

2024-09-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_write_request): Fix code style
	nits.  Restyle loops to more closely resemble similar logic in
	this file.  Reorder equality comparisons to avoid inadvertent
	lvalue assignment.

2024-09-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_write_request): Check for a
	second argument before proceeding as if it's there.  This makes
	`write` and `writec` behave more like other requests that read
	`contents` or `anything` arguments.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66255>.  Problem appears
	to date back to groff's birth.

2024-09-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

2024-09-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (close_all_streams): Drop
	copy-and-wasted line.  Harmless but pointless (we're no
	longer reading input when this function is called).

2024-09-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (pipe_output): Shorten diagnostics.

2024-09-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[gropdf]: Make pdfom handle errors and abnormal exits.

	* src/devices/gropdf/pdfmom.pl: Handle signaled and error exits
	from groff pipeline.  Improve diagnostics.  Store "basename" of
	executing command into `prog` scalar.  Gather the wait status
	returned by every use of `system()`.
	(abort): New subroutine writes a fatal diagnostic message and
	exits with status 1.
	(autopsy): New subroutine decodes a POSIX wait status to
	determine the fate of an unlucky process, and returns it as a
	human-readable string scalar.  (The interesting part is cribbed
	from Perl documentation.)

2024-09-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (table::add_entry): Throw warnings
	if comment (`\"`, `\#`) or transparent throughput (`\!`) escape
	sequences encountered in table entry.  Because these escape
	sequences cause the formatter to consume the rest of the input
	line as their argument, they don't play well with tbl, which
	tries to measure a table entry's width by interpolating it
	inside the delimited `\w` escape sequence.  You can sometimes
	get away with this (especially in simple table layouts), hence
	the mere warning, but it can't be relied upon.

2024-09-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (table::add_entry): When erroring
	about a table entry ending with (an incomplete) zero-motion
	escape sequence, spell out the escape sequence in the diagnostic
	for the benefit of *roff non-experts.

2024-09-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.sh: Support `-v` non-finally in option
	clusters.  "nroff -tv" worked while "nroff -vt" did not.  That
	was silly.  Continues commit 24d4975ebe, 12 July.

	Continues fixing <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64684>.

2024-09-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* mdate.pl: Report dates in ISO 8601 format (for man page center
	footers).  That is what we prescribe in an `-rCHECKSTYLE`
	diagnostic; it's only fair that we dog food our own
	recommendation.

2024-09-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am (set-man-page-time-stamps): New maintainer-mode
	rule sets time stamps of man page source documents to match the
	Git "author date" of their most recent commits.  This is to make
	the date reported in the center footer of the rendered page tell
	the truth.

2024-09-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.tables: Update using the Unicode
	16.0.0 version of the "UnicodeData.txt" file.

2024-09-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.tables: Update with freshly

	Deri James for the report.

2024-09-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/afmtodit/make-afmtodit-tables: Alter maintainer-mode
	script to stop excluding code points from the Private Use Area
	in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane from glyph mappings for
	Adobe fonts (and workalikes).  Doing so expands coverage to ~192
	more glyphs, including groff's "braceex".

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65716> (1/2).  Thanks to
	Deri James for the report.

2024-09-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (interpolate_macro): Fix code style
	nits.  Reorder equality comparisons to avoid inadvertent lvalue
	assignment.  Rename local variable `warned` to `was_warned` and
	demote it from `int` to `bool`.  Assign to it using Boolean, not
	integer, literals.  Explicitly compare variable of pointer type
	to null pointer literal instead of letting it pun down to a
	Boolean.  Stop treating return value of `warning()` as
	significant.  If ever there was a function that was called only
	for its side effects, that's it.

2024-09-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (device_request): Add extensive new
	logic to subvert copy mode so as to interpret special character
	escape sequences.  We don't yet support _composite_ special
	character escape sequences.
	* src/roff/groff/tests/
	device-control-special-character-handling.sh: Update and expand
	test cases.  Comment out one new case that doesn't yet work.

	This change is in further service of the grueling march toward
	resolution of <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?63074>.

2024-09-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/groff.cpp (main): Clarify verbose output.

2024-09-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/groff.cpp: Boolify variables controlling
	whether a command pipeline is constructed.
	(run_commands): Demote `no_pipe` argument from `int` to `bool`.
	(main): Rename `vflag` to `want_version_info` and demote it from
	`int` to `bool`.  Assign to it using Boolean, not integer,
	literals.
	* src/roff/groff/pipeline.c (run_pipeline):
	* src/roff/groff/pipeline.h (run_pipeline): Demote `no_pipe`
	argument from `int` to `bool`.
	* src/roff/groff/pipeline.c: Include "stdbool.h" header file.

2024-09-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[gxditview]: Accept the `-v` option groff(1) may supply.

	* src/devices/xditview/xditview.c (Syntax): Report `-v` as an
	accepted synonym of `-version` and `--version` in usage message.
	(main): Refactor argument processing.  Accept `-v`.  Handle
	early-exit options {`--help`, `--version` and their synonyms}
	_before_ checking for an excess argument count, another error
	condition.

	* src/devices/xditview/gxditview.1.man (Synopsis): Document

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (remove_macro, rename_macro)
	(alias_macro, chop_macro, stringdown_request, stringup_request)
	(substring_request, length_request): Check for arguments: if
	none are present, throw warning in category "missing" and skip
	the remainder of the input line.
	(do_string_case_transform): Add `assert()` since our callers
	now require that arguments be present.

2024-09-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (decode_string_args): Improve

2024-09-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (close_stream): Handle being given a

	Continues 6d32f2492e, 13 September.

2024-09-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (open_file): Fix unsafe-mode SEGV
	caused by null pointer dereference.  Problem introduced by me in
	commit 6d32f2492e, 13 September.  Also add assertion; null
	`FILE` stream pointers should not be getting stored in GNU
	troff's `stream_dictionary`.

2024-09-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	`#include`.

2024-09-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (report_composite_characters): Fix
	code style nit: eliminate unnecessary temporary variable.

2024-09-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Refactor.  `\X` reads its delimited argument in
	interpretation mode and the `device` request reads its argument
	in copy mode.  We want parity in special character handling for
	these formatter instructions, but one works with tokenized
	input and the other with tokens that happen to be a sequence of
	ordinary characters.  (In other words, in `\X'\[em]'` and
	`.device \[em]`, the escape sequence "knows" that it is dealing
	with a valid special character named "em", whereas the request
	merely handles '\', '[', 'e', 'm', and ']' in series.)  This
	change is in service of the grueling march toward resolution of
	<https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?63074>.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp
	(map_special_character_for_device_output): New function handles
	all of the potential special (including composite) character
	identifier rewriting formerly in...
	(encode_special_character_for_device_output): ...this function,
	which now simply calls the foregoing after extracting the
	special character identifier from the `charinfo` of the current
	token.

2024-09-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_device_extension): Make `\X`
	escape sequence begin the first page of the document if it
	hasn't begun already.  In the "grout" page description language,
	this puts the leading 'x' initialization commands on the output
	stream, which we guarantee to come first in any such document.
	Device extension commands 'x X' before that point are not
	well-defined, and further this change brings `\X` into parity
	with its sibling, the `device` request, which does so already.

2024-09-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Clean up streams on formatter exit.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (close_all_streams): New function
	iterates `stream_dictionary` and closes each stream.
	(exit_troff): Call `close_all_streams()`.

2024-09-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Add `pstream` request.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (print_streams): New request handler
	iterates through `stream_dictionary`, writing each entry.
	(init_input_requests): Wire up `pstream` request to new handler.

2024-09-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Make groff streams objects of new `grostream` class, so
	we can conveniently store more state in them.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (class grostream): Declare.
	(grostream::grostream): Declare constructor.
	(grostream::~grostream): Declare (trivial) destructor.
	(print_streams): Report mode in which the stream was opened and
	name of file backing it.
	(open_file, close_stream, do_write_request)
	(write_macro_request): Migrate to expect an object of type
	`grostream` from a `stream_dictionary.lookup()` instead of a
	pointer to `FILE`.

2024-09-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (close_request): Move stream-closing
	logic (as opposed to request argument validation) into...
	(close_stream): ...its own new function.

2024-09-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Declare global `stream_dictionary`
	as type `object_dictionary` instead of `dictionary`, since we
	want the stored values to be class objects instead of a
	primitive data type.
	(open_file, close_request): Update member function calls
	appropriately; the former class uses return values for
	`lookup()` and `remove()`, the latter does not.
	(open_file): Clarify diagnostic when we try to reorient an
	existing stream name to a new file, but can't close the old file
	associated with the stream name.
	(close_request): Remove the stream from the dictionary only if,
	and after, we have successfully closed the `FILE` stream.

2024-09-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (class input_iterator): Trivially

	(input_stack::get, input_stack::finish_get, input_stack::peek)
	(string_iterator::string_iterator, string_iterator::fill)
	(string_iterator::peek, temp_iterator::temp_iterator): Migrate.

2024-09-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Slightly refactor.  Move
	responsibility for skipping the rest of the input line...
	(open_file): ...from this internal helper function...
	(open_request, opena_request): ...to these handler functions,
	for better symmetry with other request handlers.

2024-09-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_open): The `write` request, an
	"unsafe mode" feature, has been broken for a week.  (As,
	possibly, have others that write to streams.)  Revert
	`static_cast` operators to C-style casts, which seem to be
	necessary (sometimes) with groff's bespoke, pre-STL `dictionary`
	class implementation.  Unfortunately, when static casts fail,
	they fail silently, happily handing back null pointers that you
	might not notice right away.  Fixes problem introduced by me in
	commit 3bb13e4752, 4 September.

	(source_quietly_request, pipe_source_request, open_request)

2024-09-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

2024-09-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Trivially refactor.  Rename

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp (html_system): Improve report of
	failing system(3) commands and fix code style nits.  Use
	standard constant symbol `STDOUT_FILENO` in favor of a "1"
	literal.  Parenthesize complex expressions.  Recast diagnostic
	message.  Stop misreporting the `int` return value of `system()`
	as the command's "(exit) status".  The integer _encodes_ the
	exit status in its lowest seven bits.  Distinguish the cases of
	the command exiting with a failing status, being signalled, and

2024-09-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/div.h (class top_level_diversion): Boolify and

	* src/roff/troff/div.h (class diversion, class macro_diversion)
	(class top_level_diversion): Boolify trivial member function
	`is_diversion()`.

2024-09-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/div.h (class diversion, class macro_diversion)
	(class top_level_diversion): Boolify and rename `space()` member
	function argument, demoting `forced` from `int` to `bool`, and

	`boxing`.
	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (macro_diversion::space)

	* src/roff/troff/div.h (class diversion, class macro_diversion)
	(class top_level_diversion): Boolify `output()` member function
	argument, demoting `retain_size` from `int` to `bool`.
	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (macro_diversion::output)
	(top_level_diversion::output): Boolify at definition sites.
	This variable seems to be coupled to `suppress_filling` in
	"env.cpp".

2024-09-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/div.h (do_divert): Boolify function arguments.
	Comment formal argument names as a compromise with the
	Stroustrup-style C++ used in most of groff.
	* src/roff/troff/div.h (class diversion):
	* src/roff/troff/env.h (class environment): Update friend
	declarations.
	* src/roff/troff/div.h (class macro_diversion): Similarly
	boolify and rename constructor argument.
	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (do_divert, divert, divert_append, box,
	box_append): Boolify function arguments.  Rename `append` to
	`appending`, to match the existing `boxing`.
	(macro_diversion::macro_diversion): Similarly boolify and rename
	constructor argument.

2024-09-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (begin_page): Boolify local variable
	`got_arg`.

2024-09-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/div.h (class diversion): Boolify member
	variables that cache values of Boolean member variables of
	`environment` class.  Mark them as possibly nilpotent; when I
	experimentally deleted each of them, no automated tests failed,
	and even Peter's fearfully complex mom(7) documents looked fine.
	Possibly a task for groff 1.25.

2024-09-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/div.h (class diversion): Boolify and rename
	member variable `no_space_mode` to `is_in_no_space_mode`.

2024-09-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (class diversion): Drop unused member

2024-09-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (macro_diversion::macro_diversion):
	Boolify argument to `macro` object constructor, using Boolean
	instead of integer literal.  Continues commit 7c5b8e5d4a, 27
	August.

2024-09-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (macro_diversion::macro_diversion)

2024-09-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (troff_output_file::fill_color):

	in the rest of this file.

2024-09-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (print_env): Improve environment
	report.  Don't report two items of stale data about a completed
	line, and describe them more intelligibly.  Say "text length"
	rather than "total width"; the former is what is compared to the
	already reported "target text length".  Clarify "total number of
	spaces" as "number of adjustable spaces"; that's what's really
	counted.  Relocate report of "target text length" to more
	closely follow "text length" and "number of adjustable spaces"
	to make their relationship more obvious.

2024-09-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment_copy, space_size):
	Check for arguments: if none are present, throw warning in
	category "missing" and skip the remainder of the input line.

2024-09-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment_copy): Use C++
	`static_cast` operator instead of C-style type cast.  Explicitly
	compare variable of pointer type to null pointer constant
	instead of letting it pun down to a Boolean.

2024-09-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::output_line): Resize
	stack-allocated character buffer to use constant defined by
	libgroff for formatting unsigned `int`s as strings.  Use
	sprintf(3)'s 'u' conversion, not 'd', for output line number,
	which cannot be negative.  Explicitly discard return value of
	sprintf(3).

2024-09-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp
	(troff_output_file::start_device_extension): Call `flush_tbuf()`
	before any other function that may write to device-independent
	output.

2024-09-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp
	(troff_output_file::start_device_extension): Stop calling
	`do_motion()` in argumentless version, which is called only when
	writing HTML (specifically, when inlining images).  It seemed to
	accomplish nothing.  No tests fail and "pic.html", a document
	with many images, continues to render fine.  In
	device-independent output, a pair of absolute positioning
	commands ('H' and 'V') moves to a redundant place, but the HTML
	produced is identical (except for a date stamp in a comment).

2024-09-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.

	* src/roff/troff/token.h (class token): Rename enumeration
	constant from `TOKEN_SPECIAL` to `TOKEN_SPECIAL_CHAR`.  Rename
	member function declaration from `is_special()` to
	`is_special_character()`.  Tokens can represent multiple types
	of formatter objects (at least three of which, "special
	characters", "special fonts", and "special nodes", have member
	functions named `is_special()`, and which have little to do with
	each other).
	(token::is_special): Rename this...
	(token::is_special_character): ...to this.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::next, token:operator==)
	(token::description, token::get_char)
	(token::add_to_zero_width_node_list, token::process): Use new
	enumeration constant.
	(encode_character_for_device_output): Update `is_special()`
	call site.

	* tmac/tests/an_MR-works.sh: Update test output.

2024-09-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor and reform terminology.  Call `\X`
	escape sequence and `device` request device _extension_
	instructions.  There is already, in groff, a device command
	'x u' that configures underlining of spaces (and which is
	implemented only by grotty(1)).  A dusty corner, to be sure, but
	we could support others in the future, and further, the new term
	indicates the fact that `\X` and `device` produce arguments only
	for 'x X' "sub"-commands--this has always been the case and for
	`\X` it was true even in Kernighan troff.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_device_control): Rename this...
	(do_device_extension): ...to this.
	(do_device_extension, device_request): Migrate diagnostic

2024-09-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	function.

2024-09-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: Handle discrepant `pdf{images,totext}`.

	There are at least two different implementation variants for
	pdfimages and pdftotext out there: poppler's and
	xpdfreader.com's.

	* tmac/tests/an_UR-works.sh: Cope with minute syntax differences

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66155> (1/2).

2024-09-05  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::next)

2024-09-05  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (font_size::dump_size_table): Fix

	message.

2024-09-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (usage): De-document `-h` as synonym
	for `--help`.  That's not true for GNU troff.

2024-09-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor, renaming internal symbols matching
	`glyph_color` to `stroke_color`; the latter is what our
	documentation uses, and the glyph color is applied to things
	other than glyphs--the outlines of geometric figures.

	* src/roff/troff/env.h (class environment): Rename member
	variables and functions in declarations.
	  `glyph_color` -> `stroke_color`
	  `prev_glyph_color` -> `prev_stroke_color`
	  `get_glyph_color` -> `get_stroke_color`
	  `get_prev_glyph_color` -> `get_prev_stroke_color`

	(title, environment::get_stroke_color_string): Update accesses
	to member variables.
	(init_env_requests): Wire up `gcolor` request to
	`stroke_color_change()`.  Wire up `.m` register to

	* src/roff/troff/input.h: Migrate declaration.
	(do_glyph_color): Rename this...
	(do_stroke_color): ...to this.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Migrate.
	(do_stroke_color): Use new member function name

	(read_drawing_command): Construct node using
	`get_stroke_color()`.

2024-09-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/reg.cpp (assign_register_format_request):
	Align wording of error diagnostic with warnings thrown by same
	function.

2024-09-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (is_valid_term): Reject scaling
	units other than `f` in contexts where `f` is expected
	{dimensionless values in the unit interval expressing the
	magnitude of a color channel}.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60955>.

2024-09-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (is_valid_term): Accept `p` and `s`
	scaling units in expressions where `z` is accepted.  Also fix
	code style nit: parenthesize complex expressions.

	* man/groff_diff.7.man (Fractional type sizes and new scaling

	request in nroff mode, like `fam`.

2024-09-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (override_sizes): Fix regression
	introduced in commit 5f2704d64a, yesterday.  However, it was
	hard to tell whether the request works.
	(font_size::dump_size_table): New static member function reports
	the valid size table of the environment's currently selected
	font.
	(environment::print_env): Report the valid size table.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/sizes-request-works.sh: Test it.
	* src/roff/groff/groff.am (groff_TESTS): Run test.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66164>.

2024-09-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Add tests to prevent recurrence of Savannah #66164.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/pi-request-works.sh:
	* src/roff/groff/tests/sy-request-works.sh: Do it.

	* src/roff/groff/groff.am (groff_TESTS): Run tests.

	Continues fixing <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66164>.  (We
	still need a regression test for the `sizes` request, but there
	is no straightforward means of introspecting that aspect of
	environment state at present.)

2024-09-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (pipe_output, system_request): Fix

	[troff]: Didja ever notice that `pnr` produces a lot of output,
	and it isn't sorted?  The `pnr` request now supports dumping
	only of registers specified as arguments.

	* src/roff/troff/reg.h (look_up_register): Add second argument,
	`suppress_creation`, with default `false` value, in declaration.
	* src/roff/troff/reg.cpp (look_up_register): Skip emission of
	warning and register definition on lookup of nonexistent
	register if `suppress_creation` is true.
	(dump_register): New function takes over the work, formerly in
	`dump_register_request()`, of writing to stderr.

	implementation.)

2024-09-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/reg.cpp: Trivially refactor.  Rename all

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (pipe_source, open_request)

	self-documenting, though many requests remain a bit esoteric.

	[troff]: The `kern` request now interprets arguments with
	negative values as instructions to disable the corresponding
	feature, using the *roff integer-to-Boolean conversion idiom
	instead of the C/C++ one.  Thus, if you invoke this request with
	a register interpolation, the outcome agrees with an `if` test
	of the register's value.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp: Demote type of global
	`global_kern_mode` from `int` to `bool`.
	(set_kerning_mode): Assign value to `global_kern_mode` using
	*roff integer-to-Boolean conversion idiom.  When no argument is
	present, assign using Boolean, not integer, literal.
	(init_node_requests): Back `.kern` register with an object of
	class `readonly_boolean_register` instead of
	`readonly_register`.

	[troff]: Prevent nested use of `do` requests from causing an
	assertion failure.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Improve handling of nested
	selections of compatibility mode.  Use a global STL stack of
	`bool`, `want_att_compat_stack`, to manage them.  Drop global
	`int` `do_old_want_att_compat` with its less-useful-than-hoped
	"-1" value to signal an outermost "scope".
	(do_request): Drop dubious `assert()`ion.  Push the value of
	`want_att_compat` onto the stack before invoking/calling the
	named request/macro, and pop it afterwards.
	(class enclosing_want_att_compat_reg): Add new class to handle
	dynamic construction of `.cp` register value.  I based the
	approach on an idiom heavily used in "env.cpp", where read-only
	registers are not modeled as accessors of C++ globals, because
	they interpolate per-environment state.
	(enclosing_want_att_compat_reg::get_string): Member function of
	new class constructs `.cp` register value by peeking at the top
	of `want_att_compat_stack`.
	(init_input_requests): Wire up `.cp` register to an object of
	`enclosing_want_att_compat_reg` class instead of now-dead
	`do_old_want_att_compat` global.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61100>.  Problem
	introduced by me when introducing `.cp` register in commit
	6a37bb5f00, 17 April 2020.  Thanks to Bjarni Ingi Gislason for
	suggesting the direction a minimal reproducer could take.

	special character sequence notation.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp
	(encode_special_character_for_device_output): Enhance.  When
	constructing the content of a device control escape sequence
	{and, in the future, that of a `device` request}, try harder to
	convert special characters into something meaningful.  If a
	special character identifier looks like something other than an
	attempt at a Unicode special character escape sequence already,
	try to convert it into one.  Otherwise, write any valid Unicode
	special character identifier {in groff notation: `\[u123ABC]`}
	to the macro being assembled {and thence the `special` node, and
	ultimately the `x X` command this node type produces}.
	* src/roff/groff/tests/\
	device-control-special-character-handling.sh: Update test
	expectations.  "\[u1F6C3]" is now correctly passed through, and

	[troff]: Boolify and rename member function of `node` class

	* tmac/pdf.tmac (pdfbookmark): Trivially refactor.  Rename

2024-08-24  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	[gropdf]: Make compatible with ImageMagick (IM) < 7.0.

	Peter Schaffter discovered some problems with recent changes to
	gropdf and the `PDFPIC` macro: they were not fully compatible
	with ImageMagick 6.9, which he was using.  See <https://lists.
	gnu.org/archive/html/groff/2024-08/msg00044.html>.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl: One difference in IM 6 is that
	an alpha channel of all zeroes meant the image was opaque, but
	in 7 it is reversed and means the image is wholly transparent.

	This change is documented here:-

	<http://www.imagemagick.org/script/porting.php#alpha>

	"Alpha

	We support alpha now, previously opacity.  With alpha, a value
	of 0 means that the pixel does not have any coverage information
	and is transparent; i.e. there was no color contribution from
	any geometry because the geometry did not overlap this pixel.  A
	value of QuantumRange means that the pixel is opaque because the
	geometry completely overlapped the pixel.  As a consequence, in
	version 7, the PixelInfo structure member alpha has replaced the
	previous opacity member.  Another consequence is the alpha part
	of an sRGB value in hexadecimal notation is now reversed (e.g.
	#0000 is fully transparent)."

	This is now handled by gropdf.

	There was an undocumented (I thought it came as part of
	perlmagick--it doesn't) dependency on the module
	Image::ExifTool.  This is no longer used by gropdf, so not
	required.

	* tmac/pdfpic.tmac: Another issue was that identify(1) sometimes
	reports PDF sizes that do not match the page size--it seems to
	be attempting to report the size of the image embedded in the
	PDF.  pdfinfo(1) is thus now used first on files, which
	consistently reports the page size.  This imposes a slight time
	penalty since non-PDF files endure a (failed) pdfinfo run.

2024-08-24  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	[gropdf]: Handle preconv better.

	If preconv is used, it should also be run when generating
	forward references.

	* src/devices/gropdf/pdfmom.pl: Add preconv (if requested)
	to the pre-run that generates the `pdf:bm` strings.

2024-08-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.pl: Improve information written to
	generated font description files in comments.  Name the AFM and
	map files used.  Report any options specified on the command
	line.  The idea is to make it easier for future (and current)
	maintainers to update such files because years pass between
	occurrences, and institutional memory is, if not lost, laborious
	to dredge up.  This practice might also assist users in
	producing groff description files for their own fonts.  Also
	write out a glyph's corresponding Unicode code point in the
	comment field only if one is defined.  Otherwise we get a
	comment marker followed by a tab and a newline, which Git marks
	in radioactive red.

	Begins addressing <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65697>.

2024-08-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.pl: Define `prog` scalar as only
	the "basename" of argv[0], making diagnostic and usage messages
	less garrulous; see Savannah #65110.  Add new `opt_w` scalar to
	separate it from existing `space_width` scalar so that we can
	report the options we were invoked with in a comment in the
	generated file.  Reorganize scalar representation of version
	information: new `groff_version`, which is populated at build
	time, new `short_version` which is `groff_version` stripped of
	any Git revision and partial hash information; new
	`version_stub` which holds the prefixed information identifying
	the program and project; new `output_version` which holds the
	stub and the short version; and existing `afmtodit_version`,
	which holds the stub and the (full) groff version.  Write
	`output_version` instead of `afmtodit_version` to the generated
	file.  Update call sites of `croak` and new `whine` subroutines
	to use `&` sigil and omit trailing newline.
	(croak): Assume responsibility for writing a newline at the end
	of the message.
	(whine): New subroutine throws a diagnostic marked "warning".
	Perl's `warn` output is ugly and not structured like other groff
	diagnostics.  Give it responsibility for emitting the name of
	the program.

	* NEWS: Add items for Deri's just-committed new features.

2024-06-22  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	[gropdf]: Add support for embedding bit-mapped images to a
	generated pdf.

	Currently gropdf supports the inclusion of pdf files as separate
	images, now many other image formats are supported. The pdf
	standard requires programs which process pdfs to handle embedded
	jpegs, and from version 1.5 jpeg2000 images are handled natively
	as well. (Current gropdf produces pdfs which conform to version
	1.7).

	The pdf standard supports a raw format with separate channels
	{RGB/CMYK/Grey} in 8/16/32 bit formats. This is used for other
	image formats. If there is a transparency channel it is
	converted to an 8-bit soft mask for the image.

	* src/devices/devpdf/gropdf.pl: add code to \X'pdf: pdfpic' to
	handle other image types, not just pdfs.

	* man/groff_tmac.5.man: document changes to PDFPIC macro.

	* src/devices/devpdf/gropdf.1.man: explain use of
	\X'pdf: pdfpic ...'

	* tmac/pdfpic.tmac: expand the PDFPIC macro to handle multiple
	image formats, not just embedding pdfs.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66114>.

2024-08-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/devcp1047/*: Recursively delete.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Revise `\A` and `\B` escape
	sequences to no longer interpolate anything (not even "0" for
	"false") if they lexically don't even get as far as an opening
	delimiter; in such a case they are invalid.
	(do_name_test, do_expr_test): Do it.  Change return type from
	`bool` to a pointer to a constant `char`.  Return null pointer
	if there is no delimiter.  Otherwise return string instead of
	Boolean literals.
	(token::next): Handle null pointer returns from these functions.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_overstrike, do_bracket)
	(do_device_control): Stop pushing a newline onto the input stack

	(do_overstrike, do_bracket, do_name_test, do_expr_test)
	(do_zero_width_output, do_width, do_device_control): Similarly
	when finishing up with a delimited escape sequence with a
	malformed ending.

2024-08-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Fix Savannah #66113 (misleading `\B` diagnostic).

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_expr_test): Advance the input
	token pointer at the end of the endless for loop, not the
	beginning, since `get_number_rigidly()` already left it at the
	next input character to be processed.  (Most parameterized
	escape sequence reading functions don't call an input reading
	function before entering this sort of loop, so they correctly
	advance the token pointer _first_.)

2024-08-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Fix Savannah #63142 (newlines as delims).

	Withdraw support for newlines as escape sequence delimiters.
	Only a few (6) supported this, and the rationale behind it is
	unknown.  DWB 3.3 troff didn't behave this way in any case.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_overstrike, do_bracket)
	(do_name_test, do_zero_width_output, do_width)
	(do_device_control): Do it.  As a bonus, check starting
	delimiters for these escape sequences (`\[obAZwX]`) for validity
	in general.
	(do_overstrike, do_bracket, do_zero_width_output): Avoid leaking
	memory when returning early; delete the `new` node we just
	allocated.
	(token:next): Be prepared for the `\b` and `\o` escape sequences
	to return a null pointer (if the sequence doesn't even validly
	get off the ground), as handlers for `\Z` and `\X` already are.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/\
	some_escapes_accept_newline_delimiters.sh: Delete.
	* src/roff/groff/groff.am (groff_TESTS): Drop test.

	* doc/groff.texi.in (Delimiters):
	* man/groff.7.man (Delimiters):

2024-08-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::is_usable_as_delimiter):
	Generalize diagnostics.  Anything that's invalid as a "starting"
	delimiter is invalid as an ending one, too.  Also our
	terminology has been poorly paired; we say "closing" delimiter
	but not "opening" for its counterpart.  This fixes that.

2024-08-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::is_usable_as_delimiter):
	Reject end-of-file as the starting delimiter for an escape
	sequence.

2024-08-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (make_glyph_node): Don't throw a
	warning if `get_char_for_escape_parameter()` in "input.cpp"
	already threw an error for the same input token.  Also compare
	array elements of `const char` type to character, not integer,
	literals.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?46470>.  Thanks to Hanno
	Boeck for the report.

2024-08-18  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_drawing_command): Demote
	diagnostic thrown on empty drawing command escape sequence
	argument list from error to warning in "missing" category.  I
	can imagine someone programmatically constructing a string to be

	instead of consuming and discarding input until encountering a
	matching invalid delimiter, newline, or EOF.

2024-08-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac (@M, $c): If the formatter is GNU troff,
	use value of its `.R` register instead of "10000" to indicate an
	arbitrary large integer.
	(EQ): Same, but in commented form; a formatter DoS attack is
	otherwise revealed.
	(TS): Similar; set line length to `.R` basic units minus 1n to
	avoid saturation warnings on output devices with a non-unit
	horizontal motion quantum.
	* tmac/html-end.tmac: Set page length to `.R` basic units minus
	1v to avoid saturation warnings on output devices with a

	return Boolean, not integer, literals.
	(do_zero_width): Move declaration and initialization of `n`
	local unaccountably far from its point of use to prepare for
	shoveling of most of this function's body into a `for` loop,
	required by forthcoming fix for Savannah #63142.

2024-08-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_name_test): Fix buglet in
	handling of newline as delimiter for the `\A`, `\w`, and `\Z`
	escape sequences.  An invalid C++ conditional resulted
	in a newline being interpreted both as the delimiter and as an
	input token, spuriously putting a space on the output.  Drop
	subsequent tautologous conditional: `tok != start_token` will
	always evaluate true because `tok.is_eof()` is true and
	`start_token` cannot be an EOF.

	Before:

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.  Rename `get_number()` to
	`read_measurement()`.  Part of the idea here is to use the verb
	"read" to suggest that the function advances the token pointer
	through the input stream (and it does).  Another part is to

	member function `get_number()`.

	heap-allocated memory prior to use.  If `strtok()` returns a
	null pointer, we break early from the `for` loop before
	populating it.  The only other case where we break out of the
	loop is when `lower` is 0, and we do so only after adding this 0
	to `sizes`.  Since this memory is then passed to
	`font_size::init_size_table()`, which uses a zero integer to
	detect the end of the list, we could then access uninitialized
	memory.  [The user is not required to supply a zero argument to
	the `sizes` request.  I also revised the patch to use memset(3)
	instead of (an empty) value initializer, which is a C++03
	feature.  --GBR]

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66081>.

	[troff]: Slightly refactor: boolify.

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (struct hyphen_list): Demote `hyphen`
	member from `unsigned char` to `bool` and rename it to
	`is_hyphen'.
	(hyphen_list::hyphen_list): Migrate struct initializer list to
	new name and Boolean literal.
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (hyphenate): Update assignments to use
	new name and Boolean, not integer, literals.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (glyph_node::add_self)
	(composite_node::add_self): Update comparisons to use new name.

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (struct hyphen_list): Boolify. Demote
	`breakable` member from `unsigned char` to `bool` and rename it
	to `is_breakable'.
	(hyphen_list::hyphen_list): Migrate struct initializer list to
	new name and Boolean literal.
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::hyphenate_line):
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (break_char_node::add_self): Update
	comparisons.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (break_char_node::add_self): Demote
	`have_space_node` local variable from `int` to `bool`.

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (struct node, class hmotion_node):
	Boolify.  Demote member function `set_unformat_flag()` and
	member variable `unformat` from `int` to `bool`.  These could
	use renaming, but `make_unformattable()` and `is_unformattable`
	would be terribly misleading.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (node::set_unformat_flag)
	(word_space_node::set_unformat_flag)
	(vertical_size_node::set_unformat_flag)
	(hmotion_node::set_unformat_flag): Demote return type and use
	Boolean literals for assignments and return values.
	(word_space_node::word_space_node): Use Boolean literal in
	constructor's initializer list.
	(word_space_node::word_space_node): Update data type in
	constructor's argument list.

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (class hmotion_node): Demote `was_tab`
	member from `unsigned char` to `bool`.  Use Boolean literals for
	it in constructors' initializer lists.

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (struct node): Demote `is_inner`
	argument from `int` to `bool` and assign to it using Boolean,
	not integer, literals.

2024-08-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::operator==)
	(token::operator!=, token::add_to_zero_width_node_list): Do it.

	[troff]: Throw diagnostic in event of a diversion's contents
	overflowing its maximum vertical position.  We can't do anything
	sensible in this case, so make it a fatal error.  (It's also
	more likely that your host environment will exhaust memory
	available to the `troff` process before encountering this
	problem.)

	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp: New constant symbol
	`DIVERSION_LENGTH_MAX` defines the maximum permissible vertical
	size of a diversion in basic units.  Presently, it is `INT_MAX`.
	(macro_diversion::distance_to_next_trap): When there is no
	diversion trap, or its position has already been passed, report
	the distance to `DIVERSION_LENGTH_MAX` (rather than `INT_MAX`)
	divided by the vertical resolution.
	(macro_diversion::output): Check for overflow when incrementing
	vertical position upon writing out a line, and emit fatal error
	diagnostic if it occurs.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64229>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the discussion.

2024-08-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp
	(macro_diversion::distance_to_next_trap): Return a value
	quantized to the vertical resolution of the output device.  Add

2024-08-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp: Drop Autoconf-guarded inclusion of
	<unistd.h>.  Jugding by the groff 1.16 change log this appears
	to have to do with the use of wait(2)-related macros, but
	dropping it doesn't break a glibc-based build, and our
	"src/include/nonposix.h" header has the same guarded inclusion,
	so we should still get it on unusual systems.  If a build breaks
	due to this change, we should document the specific symbol(s) we
	need and/or rely on gnulib for them.

2024-08-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Replace club with scalpel when including standard C
	library header files.

	* src/roff/troff/troff.h: Drop standard C library header file
	inclusions altogether.  This exhibited an old style of writing C
	{and C++?} where your multi-translation unit program would have
	an overarching header file, included by all your *.c files, and
	into which you stuffed all of your libc header file dependencies
	without documenting which symbols you actually needed or where.
	This tended to lead to excessive inclusion, and that tendency
	bore out here.  On a glibc-based system, GNU troff doesn't need
	4 of the 6 headers formerly #included here at all.  And we now
	use gnulib to help us with portability, which was not the case
	in 1989.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp:
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp:
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp: Include <errno.h> and annotate why.
	* src/roff/troff/reg.cpp: Include <assert.h> and annotate why.

2024-08-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_string_case_transform): Use

	Reorder equality comparison to avoid inadvertent lvalue

	to `bufp`, since it is a pointer and moreover used as a cursor
	into the word that is a candidate for hyphenation.  Pointers and
	arrays are _not_ synonymous in C/C++; see Chapter 4, _Expert C
	Programming: Deep C Secrets_, by van der Linden (1994).  Add
	assertions for further paranoia.  Use `static_cast` instead of

	[troff]: Fix Savannah #66052 (1/2).

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (hyphenate): Fix potential one-byte
	stack overwrite if attempting to hyphenate a 256-letter sequence
	within a word.  Reserve space for null terminator in `hbuf`
	character array.  Initially, this isn't necessary because the
	array is simply walked to normalize hyphenation codes by their
	equivalence classes.  However, when we subsequently look up the
	{possibly partial} word in the exception dictionaries, `hbuf`
	{or a pointer into it} needs to be treatable as a C string, thus
	null-terminated.  Respell already correct expression later in
	the code to reinforce similarity.

	tmac/*: Refactor hyphenation code declarations.

	Move `hcode` invocations from language-specific macro files
	{those that define a "groff locale", such as "english" or
	"german"} to the macro files that support 8-bit character
	encodings, because in the formatter, hyphenation codes are
	global, not environment-specific like other hyphenation data.
	{That design decision is worth reconsidering in the future,
	but feels less urgent than adding UTF-8 input support to the
	formatter, which may obviate some encoding-related issues.}

	* tmac/LOCALIZATION: Relieve groff locale contributor of
	hyphenation code definition duty.
	* tmac/de.tmac: Move Latin-1 hyphenation code definitions from
	here...
	* tmac/latin1.tmac: ...to here.  Reorganize and cover _every_
	letter glyph in ISO 8859-1, including Icelandic letters that
	German hyphenation patterns don't require.
	* tmac/ru.tmac: Move KOI8-R hyphenation code definitions from
	here...
	* tmac/koi8-r.tmac: ...to here.
	* tmac/latin2.tmac: Define Latin-2 hyphenation codes.
	* tmac/latin5.tmac: Define Latin-5 hyphenation codes.  Include
	the notorious special case for the Turkish capital dotted I, and
	annotate it for migration in the event we ever get a "tr.tmac"
	file, because this is a language-specific case mapping, not one
	strictly implied by the character encoding.
	* tmac/latin9.tmac: Define Latin-9 (ISO 8859-15) hyphenation
	codes.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?59397>.  Thanks to Werner

	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (page_length):
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (line_length, title_length): Tweak
	diagnostic to say "computed" rather than "invalid", because
	while the value we're complaining about _is_ invalid, it is also
	a numeric expression that may have traveled a great distance
	through the alimentary canal of GNU troff's arithmetic
	evaluator, and bear little resemblance to what the user typed in
	a source document.  Among other things, we no longer have any
	idea what scaling units were supplied, but can report
	measurements only in basic units.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66038>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the report.

2024-07-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/groff.texi.in (Manipulating Hyphenation): Fix incorrect
	claim and expand discussion.  A special character _can_ be an
	argument to the `hcode` request, and this has been true for over
	20 years (for example, in "tmac/ps.tmac").  Problem dates back
	to commit bd66717ef7, 16 April 2001.

	* man/groff.7.man (Request short reference):
	* man/groff_diff.7.man (New requests): Sync language with our
	Texinfo manual, and clarify.

2024-07-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (set_hyphenation_code): Restore
	diagnostic message when attempting to assign the hyphenation
	code of a special character to another character (special or
	ordinary).  Also initialize local variable much closer to where
	we test its value, for readability.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66040>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the report.

2024-07-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (get_vunits, get_hunits, get_number)
	(get_integer): Align assertion error messages with function
	names.

2024-07-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (is_valid_expression_start): Fix
	missing space in diagnostic message.

2024-07-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (vunits::vunits, hunits::hunits):
	Migrate to C23 checked arithmetic macros.  Throw error if
	addition overflows.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64301>.  (For real this
	time, fingers crossed.)

2024-07-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/tests/arithmetic-works.sh: Add more tests.

2024-07-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (vunits::vunits, hunits::hunits):
	Move common subexpression to a temporary variable to prepare for
	reuse in C23 checked artihmetic macros.

2024-07-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Enforce minimum page length.

	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (page_length): Clamp `pl` request
	argument to the output device's vertical resolution (similarly
	to the way `ll` and `lt` behave).

	* doc/groff.texi.in (Page Layout):
	* NEWS: Document this.

2024-07-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (line_length, title_length): Drop use
	of needless temporary variable `minimum_length`.  Use global
	variable `hresolution` instead of static class member variable
	`font::hor`.  Clarify wording of warning diagnostic message when
	{title} line length invalid.

2024-07-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl (interpret_line): Fix logic error; set
	Boolean scalar `have_seen_first_macro_call` _after_ testing it,
	not before, avoiding its tautological truth.
	(infer_man_or_ms_package): Drop `TH` from list of "unique"
	man(7) macro names.  It isn't; most full-service macro packages
	use it to manage tbl(1) headings, and we already have special
	logic for handling it as the first call in a page anyway (where
	it is overwhelmingly idiomatic of a man(7) document).

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66006>.  Thanks to Morten
	Bo Johansen for the report.

2024-07-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Regression-test Savannah #66006.

2024-07-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (is_char_usable_as_delimiter): Reject
	`|`.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?66009>.

2024-07-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Add test of *roff arithmetic.

2024-07-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Prevent traps on overflowing integer arithmetic.

	* bootstrap.conf: Add "stdckdint" to `gnulib_modules`.
	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp: Include `config.h` and
	`stdckdint.h` headers.
	(get_number, get_integer, is_valid_expression): Use `ckd_add()`,
	`ckd_sub()`, and `ckd_mul()` instead of primitive operations,
	and throw error diagnostic if arithmetic wraps.
	(is_valid_expression): Remove manual detection of overflow.
	(get_vunits, get_hunits): Use `ckd_add()` (with temporary
	variable, annotating why) instead of primitive operation, and
	throw error diagnostic if arithmetic wraps.
	(is_valid_term): When parsing integer literals, remove manual
	detection of overflow, relying on `ckd_mul()` and `ckd_add()` to
	indicate it.  When an overflowing literal is encountered, skip
	excess digits.  This is a behavior change, albeit an esoteric
	one; evaluation of a numeric term no longer aborts in this
	scenario.  When applying the *roff `|` boundary-relative motion
	operator, remove manual detection of overflow, relying on
	`ckd_sub()` to indicate it, and store result to temporary
	variable in case it overflows and must be discarded.  Otherwise,
	copy temporary to the storage for the term being interpreted.
	When negating a term, remove manual detection of negation of
	`INT_MIN` (guaranteed to overflow in a two's complement
	representation), relying on `ckd_mul()` to indicate it.

	* src/roff/troff/hvunits.h: Include `config.h` and `stdckdint.h`
	headers.
	(vunits operator -, hunits operator -): Use `ckd_sub()` instead
	of primitive operation, and throw error diagnostic if arithmetic
	wraps.
	(vunits::to_units, hunits::to_units): Use `ckd_mul()` instead of
	primitive operation, and throw error diagnostic if arithmetic
	wraps.
	(vunits operator +, hunits operator +): Use `ckd_add()` instead
	of primitive operation, and throw error diagnostic if arithmetic
	wraps.
	(vunits operator *, hunits operator *): Use `ckd_mul()` instead
	of primitive operation, and throw error diagnostic if arithmetic
	wraps.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64301>.  You had to
	compile GNU troff with the (GCC) compiler option `-ftrapv` for
	arithmetic to trap and cause a core dump.

2024-07-18  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (is_valid_term): Trivially refactor
	implementation of boundary-relative ("absolute" [sic]) motion
	operator.  Rename `tem` to `position`, since it is the
	horizontal or vertical drawing location to be altered.
	Parenthesize expressions for clarity.

2024-07-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Refactor `has_arg()` to optionally work in copy mode.

	* src/roff/troff/token.h (has_arg): Add Boolean parameter,
	defaulting to `false`, indicating that "peeking" ahead in the
	input stream is desired.  This is for use by requests that need
	to read their argument(s) in copy mode.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (has_arg): Implement, moving code
	duplicated in `device_request` and `output_request`.
	(device_request, output_request): Drop duplicated code in favor
	of calling `has_arg()` with `true` argument.

2024-07-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (device_request): Honor a `device`
	request even if it precedes any formatted output, as we do the
	`\X` escape sequence.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65977>.

2024-07-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (get_long_name): Call
	`do_get_long_name()` with null character literal for parameter
	of `char` type, rather than punning an integral zero.
	(do_get_long_name): Rename parameter from `end` to `end_char`.

2024-07-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* bootstrap: Resync with gnulib upstream.  Thanks to Dave Kemper
	for the report and Collin Funk for the suggested fix.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65800>.

2024-07-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (is_valid_term): Trivially refactor;
	simplify tautologus Boolean expression.

2024-07-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description): Revise
	diagnostic when reporting unexpected character code > 128 in
	input.  Report only its code in decimal and Unicode-style
	hexadecimal instead of trying to write it literally.

	Continues <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65724>.

2024-07-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/pic.ms: Reduce vertical spacing in displays only on
	typesetters.  To that end:
	(SS): Define new macro for starting a "small display".
	(SE): ...and a macro for ending one.
	Migrate use of `DS`/`DE` macros with `ps` and `vs` requests to
	the new macros.

2024-07-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/groff_mdoc.7.man: Manipulate type size and vertical
	spacing only in troff mode.

2024-07-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (is_valid_term): Boolify.  Rename
	`negative` to `is_negative` and demote it and `do_next` from
	`int` to `bool`.  Assign to them with Boolean, not integer,
	literals.

2024-07-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (is_valid_expression, get_hunits)
	(get_number, get_integer, is_valid_term): Trivially refactor.
	Replace `v` as the general name for any numeric quantity
	{possibly arising from copy-and-paste operations from a
	`vunits`-handling original} with one more suggestive of its
	type: `h`, `u`, or `i` for horizontal, general, or integral
	units respectively.

2024-07-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/hvunits.h: Boolify.
	(vunits:operator <, vunits::operator >, vunits::operator <=)
	(vunits:operator >= vunits::operator ==, vunits::operator !=)
	(hunits:operator <, hunits::operator >, hunits::operator <=)
	(hunits:operator >= hunits::operator ==, hunits::operator !=):
	Return `bool` instead of `int`.

2024-07-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-ext.tmac (DS, DE): Drop (empty) macro definitions,
	introduced in groff 1.20 (January 2009).
	* NEWS: Document this.  Technically, it's an interface change.
	Any man page calling these macros (without defining them itself)
	will prompt warnings if GNU troff is given the `-wmac` option
	{or equivalent}.

2024-03-19  Alexis Hildebrandt <afh@surryhill.net>

	[grohtml]: Migrate from psselect(1) to ps2ps(1).

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp (imageList::createPage): Do it.
	* src/devices/grohtml/grohtml.1.man (Dependencies): Document
	the changed runtime requirement.
	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_CHECK_GROHTML_PROGRAMS):
	* src/roff/groff/tests/html_works_with_grn_and_eqn.sh:
	* src/roff/groff/tests/smoke-test_html_device.sh: Check for
	existence of `ps2ps` command instead of `psselect`.

	* ANNOUNCE:
	* NEWS:
	* README:
	* README.MinGW: Document change in dependencies.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65987>.

2024-07-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/searchpath.cpp (is_directory): New function
	uses stat(2) to check file name argument to see if it's a
	directory, and returns a Boolean.
	(search_path::open_file):
	(search_path::open_file_cautious): Use `is_directory()` before
	attempting to `fopen()` a file specification; fail and set
	`errno` to `EISDIR` if it's a directory so that the caller
	reports a useful diagnostic.

	* bootstrap.conf: Add gnulib `stat` module, because the story of
	POSIX and non-POSIX systems alike trying and failing to sensibly
	implement the fundamental Unix file system model is a sorry tale
	of indifference and self-owns by rock star programmers.
	{Seriously, read the "sys/stat.h" and "stat" sections of the
	gnulib manual.}

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65980>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the report.

2024-07-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-ext.tmac: Fix incomplete changes to support `YS` with
	an argument to reuse indentation of previous synopsis.  (An
	insufficiently aggressive test case is a dangerous thing.)
	Revise meaning of `mS` register from "are we in a synopsis?" to
	"are we reusing the previous synopsis's indentation?"
	(SY): Save hyphenation and adjustment modes and disable
	automatic hyphenation if we have any arguments.
	(YS): Set `mS` register if we have any arguments, otherwise
	clear it.

	* tmac/tests/an_HY-register-works.sh: Drop test cases on
	"nested" synopses.  These are now ill-formed and no longer
	supported.  See "NEWS" file.

2024-07-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tests/an-ext_SY-and-YS-work.sh: Test new behavior of `YS`
	when given an argument.

	* src/preproc/eqn/main.cpp (main):

	diagnostic when a startup file cannot be opened for some reason

	* src/libs/libgroff/searchpath.cpp
	(search_path::open_file_cautious):

	Reorder comparisons with null pointers to avoid inadvertent
	lvalue assignment.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (text_file::next_line, scale_round)
	(font::get_width, font::alloc_ch_index, font::load_desc): Do the

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (writable_lineno_reg::set_value): Use
	explicit void cast when ignoring function's return value.

2024-07-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load, font::load_desc):
	Reduce cleverness of assignment nested inside conditional--a
	favorite of C obscurantists and an especially gratuitous case
	since it was preceded by a declarator without an initializer.
	This aligns `font::load()` with another overloaded version of
	itself and with `font::scan_papersize()`.

2024-07-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (file_iterator::set_location): Stop
	initializing the output.  Preprocessing empty documents could
	lead to baffling results.  In groff 1.22.4 and before, you'd get
	a blank document from some output drivers despite no evident
	reason from the preprocessed input that this should be the case.
	In groff 1.23.0, this happened for fewer output drivers but
	still generated a mysterious diagnostic.

	  fatal error: 'V' command invalid before first 'p' command

	It turns out to be unnecessary to initialize `the_output` upon
	encountering an `lf` request.  The spurious output aspect of the
	problem dates back to commit e092fba4517, 6 February 2000
	{"groff pre-1.16"}.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65983>.

2024-07-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (number_lines): Clarify diagnostics;

	* src/devices/grolbp/lbp.cpp (main): Fix range check after

	[libgroff,libbib,indxbib]: Add, use `ceil_prime()`.

	* src/include/lib.h:
	* src/libs/libgroff/prime.cpp (ceil_prime): Add function to get
	the lowest prime not less than n.  While at it, fix the logic,
	which was incorrect in the open-coded call sites, since for an
	input of 1, it produced 3, but the first prime is 2.  A recent
	commit started rejecting 1 earlier, so this bug was now
	impossible to trigger, but remained there.

	Also, since this is a library function, let's behave well for an
	input of 0, which is mathematically fine, and return also the
	first prime, 2.

	* src/libs/libbib/index.cpp
	(index_search_item::read_common_words_file):

	[gropdf] Deal better with invalid destination names.

	Bookmark destinations (supplied by -T to .pdfbookmark)
	are "Name Objects" in pdf terms, as such they are limited
	to characters in the range 33 (!) to 126 (~). Characters
	outside this range must be coded as a # followed by the
	2 digit hex number. So a space character should be '#20'.

	Gropdf produces pdfs which conform to this rule, but the
	pdf parser (used to import pdfs for pdfpic) expects only
	valid syntax. To convert pdfmark input to a pdf object
	gropdf used this inbuilt parser.

	The .TH macro in an.tmac passes its first parameter as a
	bookmark destination. Normally this is fine, since the
	convention is that this will be the name of the program
	the man page is documenting. The problem in this case
	is the line:-

	.TH "Pamaltsat User Manual" 0 "14 September 2018"
	    "netpbm documentation"

	The first parameter contains spaces, which yields invalid
	syntax when parsed as "/Dest /Pamaltsat User Manual(0)".

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf: Don't use internal parser
	on "user" supplied input, be a bit more careful.

	Fixes:-

	[tmac]: Perform actual string comparisons.

	* tmac/fallbacks.tmac:
	* tmac/troffrc-end: Bracket comparands to formatted output
	comparison operator with `\?` escape sequences to perform a more
	elementary string comparison on them (cf. a comparison of
	_formatted text_).  This way they continue to perform their
	function even if the default font family has no coverage of
	Basic Latin (not a bizarre choice when considering potential
	rendering of documents using Devanagari or East Asian
	languages).  Unfortunately this means of comparing strings,
	while long documented in the GNU troff Manual, is neither
	idiomatic for *roff macro programmers nor portable to AT&T
	troff.  (The *roff language historically _lacks_ a string
	comparison operator.)  Each macro package will have to decide
	for itself whether it wants to have portability at the expense
	of requiring Basic Latin coverage (possibly switching fonts
	before and after a formatted output comparison for the sole
	purpose of obtaining it).  These two files are unconditionally
	loaded by the stock `troffrc`, and therefore must be dealt with
	in any case.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64155>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the report, and to him, Peter Schaffter, and Deri
	James for the discussion.

	[man]: Revise and expand `SY` and `YS` macro behavior, largely
	to accommodate C library function synopses.  `SY` no longer puts
	vertical space on the output, and initially breaks the output
	line _only_ if it is encountered repeatedly without a preceding
	`YS` call.  The computed indentation of synopsis lines after the
	first now also includes the width of anything on the line
	_before_ the synopsis, so that you can precede the `SY` call
	with, for instance, the C language data type used for the return
	value in a function prototype.  The `SY` macro now accepts an
	optional second argument.  This second argument is typeset in
	bold, replaces the fixed-width space that is appended to the
	synopsis keyword in `SY`'s single-argument form, and is used in
	computation of the indentation of non-initial synopsis lines.

	...unless overridden.  You can now reuse the indentation amount
	computed in a previous synopsis.  To do this, give any argument
	to the `YS` macro call "closing" the synopsis whose indentation
	you want to reuse.  When you're done with such a grouped
	synopsis, simply leave the argument off the final `YS` call.

	Finally, the `SY` macro is now effectively a no-op if it is
	called with no arguments; no text is discarded.

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.  Rename node and node list dumping

	Report the previous and current resolved font names alongside

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::print_env): Stop
	reporting the value of the "discarding" flag as a property of
	the *roff environment.  There's no corresponding concept in CSTR
	#54 or groff's documentation.  It is an internal
	implementation detail having to do with the disposal of trailing
	spaces on input lines (and not even in general at that; as far
	as I can tell it applies only when the `\p` escape sequence is
	also used).  Move the report of its value from here...
	(environment::dump_troff_state): ...to here, a member function
	that is only reachable if the `DEBUGGING` preprocessor symbol is
	defined and if one is using a debugger on an unstripped troff

	(PDFDate): Accept an epoch-seconds argument rather than a

2024-04-24  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	[gropdf] use nospace mode if font does not contain
	/space glyph.

	Gropdf always had two modes, depending on whether the font
	defined /space or not (using space could make the pdf
	slightly more compact). Some fonts which don't have /space
	do have a glyph named /u0020 and the code used that as a
	space, however I'm not convinced of the robustness of this
	so, now, if a font has no /space then nospace mode is used.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl: Always use nospace mode if
	font has no /space glyph.

	[gropdf] Can't handle DecodeParams in Deflate filter.

	If gropdf called with -d (debug) the pdf is produced with
	objects uncompressed, if object does not use default deflate
	parameters Zlib does not decompress properly, so the
	decompressed object is invalid. This affects when using a
	pdf imported with 'pdfpic' which contains a png image.

	This only affects imported pdfs when using the -d flag,
	because otherwise it is just passed through with no
	decompress.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl: Don't decompress if object has
	a DecodeParams dictionary.

	[gropdf] Handle both types in one document.

	The different format of font described in previous commit fails
	if document contains fonts of both formats. The reason is
	because the regexes included the /o flag (compile once) for
	speed, but if the format changed (from RD to -|) in a different
	font, parsing failed.

	Now the regexes are compiled once for each font.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl: Use qr// to compile regexes once
	per font.

2024-04-17  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	[gropdf] Improve font parsing.

	The usual (for fontforge converted ttf fonts) is to use the RD,
	ND and NP operators within charstring definitions, however these
	are just named in the private subrs dictionary so could be
	assigned any name.

	A debian .pfb version of a google .ttf font (which has not
	passed through fontforge) used -| |- and | as the 3 equivalent.
	In addition it used a different lenIV value for the eexec
	encryption (4) and the charstring encryption (0) (didn't know
	you could do that).

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl: Make RD, ND and NP variables set
	from parsing the private subrs. Honour lenIV=0 when encrypting
	charstrings.

2024-04-16  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	[gropdf] Problem with '(' and '\' (\[rs])

	Both these tokens have meaning for roff AND pdf strings. In
	pdfs unbalanced parentheses have to be escaped (with '\') and
	a single '\' has to be similarly escaped, '\\'. It is gropdf's
	responsibility to ensure pdf strings are valid, no matter what
	the input.

	If '\(ul' is passed then the UTF-16 character becomes '_'.
	If '\[rs](ul' is passed (i.e. '\(ul' is intended to become the
	UTF-16 string) \[rs] becomes '\' leaving '\(ul', which
	becomes '_', not what is intended. If the unbalanced '(' is
	escaped first, '\[rs]\(ul' which could become '\\_' when the '\'
	is escaped, yielding '\_'. The code which escapes parenthesis
	checks it is not already preceded by '\' since adding another
	would give you '\\(' which is not what you want. The correct
	output should be '\\\(ul' to achieve the correct pdf string.

	This fixes the above issue (I hope).

	[troff]: Retire "el" warning category.

	It's much too hard to perform this analysis without the risk of
	throwing this warning spuriously.  Paul Eggert reported a
	real-world use of `ie`/`el` requests nested without the use of
	brace escape sequences in his zic(8) man page that is
	structurally equivalent to the following (with indentation added
	for clarity).

	.ie \nA .tm register A is truthy
	.el .ie t .tm in typesetter mode
	.    el   .tm in terminal mode

	Without brace escape sequences, the `skip_branch()` function
	that discards input corresponding to control flow branches not
	taken does not reliably keep track of the nesting level.  So why
	not just make `skip_branch()` more sophisticated to handle this
	case?  Because it doesn't generalize.  What if the input changes
	the control character, or uses the no-break control character?
	What if the input has renamed the `ie` request or invokes it
	through a macro?

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Drop this warning category from the
	`warning_table` global.
	(else_request): Stop throwing it.
	* src/roff/troff/troff.h: Comment out its value in the
	`warning_type` enum.

	* doc/groff.texi.in (if-else, Warnings):
	* src/roff/troff/troff.1.man (Warnings): De-document "el" troff
	warning category.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65474>.  Thanks to Paul
	Eggert for the report.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (skip_branch): Handle control flow
	branches consisting only of a newline correctly when skipping
	them--actually skip them, as AT&T troff does.  A newline after
	the `el` request, or after the conditional expression of an
	`if`, `ie`, or `while` request, is not "nothing"; if the branch
	is taken, it puts a newline on the output, and if it is not
	taken, it should neither affect output nor be _syntactically_
	ignored on the pretense that the next input line was actually
	part of the branch.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?45502>.  Problem likely
	goes back to groff's origin.  (You could always avoid it with
	brace escape sequences, which might explain why it seemed to
	cause little consternation.)  Thanks to Carsten Kunze for the
	report and to Dave Kemper for the code review.

	* tmac/{ja,ru,zh}.tmac: Add heuristic checks for glyph coverage
	of characteristic code points for these languages' scripts.
	Throw the warning only once for each language.  The formatter
	will merrily spew "special character ... not defined" error
	diagnostics for each non-covered glyph encountered; this leads
	people to complain that "groff doesn't support Unicode".  (This
	additional warning diagnostic might not help much; the error
	diagnostics already refer to characters in these scripts _by
	their Unicode code points_, which should be a clue, but too
	often isn't.)  And this one will slip through even if someone
	runs groff (or troff) with the `-E` option.  If you want to
	typeset Unicode, you have to use a font that covers Unicode.
	groff can't force one onto your system.  (We could do more to

	* tmac/mdoc/doc-syms (doc-St-usage): Use new `doc-report-usage`
	macro instead of hand-crafting diagnostic message with `tm`
	request.

	* tmac/doc.tmac (Bl): Drop unneccessary argumentless `tm` request.
	(doc-Bl-usage): Use three single-line `doc-report-usage`
	requests instead of writing a six-line diagnostic.  Both are
	regrettable--`Bl` is just crazily complex.
	(doc-defunct-macro): Use new `doc` string to construct bespoke
	diagnostic complaining of defunct macro usage.

	* tmac/doc.tmac (Bk):
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-common (LP, PP, pp, SH):
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-syms (At, Dx, Fx, Nx, St, Lb): Use new
	`doc-warn` macro instead of hand-crafting diagnostic message
	with `tm` request.

	Continues fixing <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?52463>, which I
	should have known would not stay dead for long.  (And which I
	won't be surprised to see scrabble forth from the grave again.)

2024-03-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/doc.tmac (Xr): When formatting PDF, automatically attempt
	lookups of `Xr` destinations as internal bookmark tags.  If
	lookup succeeds, link to the within-document destination rather
	than an "external" URL like "man:foobar(1)".

	For example, this enables "outbound" links from the
	groff_mdoc(7) page to the other ~60 documents collected in
	"groff-man-pages.pdf".

2024-03-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/mdoc/doc-common (Os): When formatting PDF, automatically
	give each `Os` call a named PDF bookmark tag that can be used in
	links (inside the guts of the `Xr` macro).

	For example, this enables "inbound" links to the groff_mdoc(7)
	page in "groff-man-pages.pdf".

2024-03-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[pdf,man,mdoc]: Refactor a recent feature.

	The "pdfhref pipe" feature recently added used in-band signaling
	to indicate that a PDF mark hotspot should be left open by the
	`pdhref` hyperlink management macro.  I'm uneasy with this
	because it forecloses the possibility of using the chosen
	in-band signal content as link text.  (Compounding the risk of
	user frustration is that there's no documentation of any of
	this.)  Replace it by adding a new `-S` flag to the `pdfhref`
	macro, indicating the caller's desire to manage closing of the
	hotspot themselves, as "tmac/an.tmac" does already.

	See <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61434#comment5>.

	* tmac/pdf.tmac (pdfhref): Initialize `pdf:href-S` register to
	zero (false).
	(pdf:href.opt-S): Define new alias for `pdf:href.flag`, so the
	{complex, Unix command-emulating} `pdfhref` argument management
	system treats it as a Boolean parameter.
	(pdf*href): Rename `pdf:href.pipe` register to
	`pdf:href.leave-mark-open`.  Throw error and don't honor "-S"
	parameter if the user has also specified a link text appendment
	with the "-A" option.  (If we're not closing the hotspot, we
	don't know where the appendment will go.)  Stop treating link
	text (the `PDFHREF.DESC` string) specially if it is "|".

	* tmac/an.tmac (an*end-hyperlink, MR):
	* tmac/doc.tmac (doc-begin-hyperlink-pdf): Migrate to new API.

2024-03-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/pdf.tmac (pdf*href): Fix derpy syntax error, introduced
	by me in commit cd9fde325f, 4 March.  Exposed by a pending
	change.

2024-03-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: When formatting PDF, attempt lookups of `MR` destinations
	as internal bookmark tags.  If lookup succeeds, link to the
	within-document destination rather than an "external" URL like
	"man:foobar(1)".

	* doc/GMPfront.t.in: Drop `END` dummy macro and redefinition of
	`MR` macro, moving the logic from here...
	* tmac/an.tmac (MR): ...to here, and trivially refactoring to
	rename variables for intelligibility.  Also simplify, using the
	"dangling open mark" incantation of the `pdfhref` macro that
	Deri innovated, since the existing logic unconditionally writes
	the link text subsequently.

2024-03-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: When formatting PDF, automatically give each `TH` call a
	named PDF bookmark tag that can be used in links (inside the

	* doc/GMPfront.t.in (reload-man [appendment]): Move logic for
	declaring a named ("tagged") bookmark from here...
	* tmac/an.tmac (an*bookmark*pdf): ...to here.

2024-03-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/pdf.tmac (pdf*href): Fix problem with hotspot placement
	when there is no link text (illustrated by the "See also"
	section of pic(1) when rendered to PDF).  It is apparently
	necessary to flush the output buffer immediately after
	constructing certain device control nodes ("pdf: markstart" and
	"pdf: markend" in this case).  Deri understands this stuff
	better than I do; the misapprehensions I exhibited in Savannah
	#65052 might be related.  If that's the case, then the issue is
	maintaining synchrony between the formatter's idea of the
	drawing position and the output driver's.

	no marker argument).

	* src/utils/indxbib/indxbib.cpp: Validate `-h` option arguments
	more carefully.
	(main): Insist on an argument value of at least 2, since a hash
	table of size 1 is pointless.
	(check_integer_arg): Try to be more robust in the face of
	C/C++'s notoriously lax integer sizing practices.  We might
	consider gnulib's "xstrtol" module.  Promote `-h` argument
	validation errors to `fatal()`.  Only perform a comparison
	against INT_MAX if LONG_MAX is larger than INT_MAX in the first
	place.  Report the supported range in range diagnostics.  Use
	C++- instead of C-style type cast of result.

2024-03-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[pdf]: Implement linear bookmark tag search.

	* tmac/pdf.tmac (pdf:lookup): Given an argument, search defined
	bookmark tags for a match and return one (if found) in the
	string `pdf:lookup-result`, which is defined but empty if there
	is no match.  Previously (and, for mom(7), still--see below),
	lookups were O(1) because strings named `pdf:look($TAG_NAME)`
	were defined.  The speed was great but unfortunately, in
	practical use, tags often got *roff escape sequences stuck into
	them, which drew diagnostic messages from the formatter and
	could defeat the matches.
	(pdfbookmark, pdf*href-M): Use the new mechanism to record a
	bookmark tag if `PRINTSTYLE` (a mom(7) macro) is _not_ defined,
	so as to not regress documents using that package.  Store the
	tag text in the string `pdf:bm\\n[pdf:bm.nr].tag`; every PDF
	bookmark in a groff document gets a serial number already.
	(pdf*href): Use the new mechanism to call `pdf:lookup` and
	locate a match for the desired tag.

	* doc/GMPfront.t.in (an*cln): Delete this macro.  It iterated
	through a string, scrubbing it of `\%` escape sequences.  Much
	more exotic things could be placed in bookmark tags; we were
	fortunate that man page cross references tend to stick to ASCII,
	plus `\%` to suppress hyphenation.  But that's suitable only for
	man page references; if we want taggable (sub)section headings,
	like groff_mmse(7)'s "Se också", we need strings, not just valid
	groff identifiers.
	(an*bookmark): Populate `an*page-ref-nm` without cleaning it
	first.

2024-03-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/GMPfront.t.in: Resync `MR` replacement with its

2024-03-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/pdf.tmac (pdfclean): Fix missing closing brace escape
	sequence.  Appears to have done no damage; possibly the end of
	the macro definition reset the formatter's state.  Or maybe we
	simply got lucky with diversions with the documents in our tree.

2024-03-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Improve encoding of *roff string contents when
	interpolated into device control escape sequences.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (encode_char_for_troff_output):
	Discard several escape sequences from `\X` contents when
	interpolated: `\%`, `\:`, `\&`, `\)`.  Interpolate the escape
	character into device-independent output as `\` no matter what
	the *roff escape character is defined to be.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/\
	device-control-special-character-handling.sh: Update test
	expectations.  Comment out some tests that depended on a
	reverted commit of a half-baked idea.  (See Savannah #64484.)

	[mdoc]: Implement hyperlink support.

	* tmac/doc.tmac: Recognize `U` register as man(7) does to enable
	hyperlinking, defaulting on.
	(doc-begin-hyperlink-ascii):
	(doc-begin-hyperlink-cp1047):
	(doc-begin-hyperlink-latin1):
	(doc-begin-hyperlink-utf8):
	(doc-begin-hyperlink-html):
	(doc-begin-hyperlink-pdf):
	(doc-end-hyperlink-ascii):
	(doc-end-hyperlink-cp1047):
	(doc-end-hyperlink-latin1):
	(doc-end-hyperlink-utf8):
	(doc-end-hyperlink-html):
	(doc-end-hyperlink-pdf): New macros produce appropriate device
	control commands to start and stop hyperlinking of formatted
	text.
	(doc-begin-hyperlink-nop, doc-end-hyperlink-nop): New do-nothing
	macros handle user-driven hyperlink disablement for devices
	lacking hyperlink support.  Create aliases for the "X100",
	"X100-12", "X75", "X75-12", "dvi", "lbp", "lj4", and "ps"
	devices corresponding to these.
	(doc-Xr-usage, doc-Mt-usage, doc-Lk-usage): New macros eliminate
	repeated logic to emit usage messages.
	(Xr): Heavily rewrite to support production of hyperlinked
	argument text.  In mdoc, there appears to be no mechanism to
	inject macro calls later in the argument stream.  To correctly
	place a `doc*end-hyperlink` call, we must parse (optional)
	arguments ourselves until we have seen enough to know we've
	reached the end of the link text (an inline macro call,
	punctuation, or the end of the input line).  Throw usage
	diagnostic in more cases of bad input.
	(Mt): Include "mailto:" schema in generated hyperlink but not in
	visible link text.
	(Mt, Lk): Call device-appropriate `doc-{begin,end}-hyperlink`
	macros.
	(Lk): Hyperlink argument only if it is a "string" (mdoc parlance
	for formattable text as opposed to a macro name or punctuation).
	Format link text as groff man(7) does, not like mandoc(1) does,
	with its "link-text: <url>" presentation.
	* tmac/mdoc.local: Add commented code illustrating how to
	disable hyperlinking.

	* tmac/tests/doc_Lk-respects-sentence-ending-punctuation.sh:
	* tmac/tests/doc_Lk-works.sh:
	* tmac/tests/doc_Mt-works.sh:
	* tmac/tests/doc_Xr-works.sh:
	* tmac/tests/doc_heading-font-remapping-works.sh: Update test
	expectations and check output when hyperlink output enabled and
	disabled.

	* NEWS:
	* tmac/groff_mdoc.7.man (Options): Document it.

2024-02-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tests/doc_Xr-works.sh: Add checks of inline `Pf` and `Ns`
	call behavior after `Xr`.

2024-02-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tests/doc_heading-font-remapping-works.sh: Dump output of
	test case in plain text in addition to device-independent *roff
	format.

2024-02-22  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[mdoc]: Rename a test.

	* tmac/tests/doc_Lk-respect-sentence-ending-punctuation.sh:
	Rename this...
	* tmac/tests/doc_Lk-respects-sentence-ending-punctuation.sh:
	...to this.
	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac_TESTS): Update.

2024-02-22  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tests/doc_Xr-works.sh: Unit-test `Xr` macro.
	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac_TESTS): Run test.

2024-02-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac (an*end-hyperlink): Fix bug: when no link text
	was supplied, the fallback link text (the hyperlink itself) was
	not appearing in PDF output.  This bug was masked by another:
	the "no link text supplied" branch was never being taken because
	the wrong diversion dimension register was being tested.  Test
	register `dl` instead of `dn` and annotate the reasoning.  Emit
	the trailing text in two places in the logic, since the
	`pdfhref` macro takes over this function with its `-A` parameter
	{which we now use}, but wasn't designed to accommodate the use
	case where we start the mark with one call and close it with
	another, which we use for the "no link text supplied" case.

2024-02-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tests/an_UR-works.sh: Add tests of PDF output, using
	pdftotext(1) (from poppler-utils) to scrape the text from PDF.

2024-02-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/pdf.tmac (pdfbookmark): Validate bookmark level argument;
	complain if it is not a numeric expression and treat it as "1".

2024-02-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac (an*end-hyperlink): Trivially refactor.  Store
	the first argument in a string named `an*trailing-text` (and use
	it) to clarify later logic.  Delete the string when done.

2024-02-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: Trivially refactor.

	* tmac/an.tmac: Revise mechanism for detecting new page headings
	that should get a top-level bookmark.
	(an-end, (initialization)): Make new string
	`an*previous-page-ref-string` empty.
	(TH, PT): Drop `an*was-TH-bookmark-emitted` register.
	(PT): Compare `an*page-ref-string` to
	`an*previous-page-ref-string`; emit a bookmark if they differ.

2024-02-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[mdoc]: Trivially refactor (DRY).

	* tmac/mdoc/doc-ditroff:
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-nroff: Move string definitions that are
	identical from here...
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-common: ...to here.

2024-02-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/mdoc/doc-nroff (ua): Define string as `ha` special
	character, not "^".  This is (probably) a matter only of
	pedantic correctness, as this definition takes place only in the
	"else" block of a conditional testing for the "utf8" output
	device, and no other supported nroff-mode device renders "^"
	surprisingly to ASCII nostalgics.

2024-02-20  Lennart Jablonka <humm@ljabl.com>

	* src/preproc/eqn/main.cpp: This file includes header
	<stdlib.h>.  As part of the C++ standard library, <stdlib.h>
	provides a bunch of stuff, including `atexit()`, in the global
	name space; it need not provide that stuff in the `std` name
	space.

	See <https://eel.is/c++draft/support.c.headers.other>.

2024-02-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/grops/psrm.cpp
	(resource_manager::read_download_file): Stop interpreting spaces
	as token delimiters, so that PostScript font files with spaces
	in their names can be handled (read and embedded in the
	generated PostScript).
	* src/devices/grops/grops.1.man (Usage): Update documentation.

	* NEWS: Add item reporting this user-visible change.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65246>.  Thanks to Deri
	James for the report.

	[output drivers]: Reset line number at end of input.

	* src/devices/grodvi/dvi.cpp (dvi_printer::~dvi_printer):
	* src/devices/grohtml/post-html.cpp
	(html_printer::~html_printer):
	* src/devices/grolbp/lbp.cpp (lbp_printer::~lbp_printer):

	* src/devices/grops/ps.cpp (ps_printer::~ps_printer):
	* src/devices/grotty/tty.cpp (tty_printer::~tty_printer): Clear
	line number when tearing down output writer so that diagnostic
	messages aren't emitted with a misleading (and nonexistent) line
	number (the number of lines in the device-independent output
	file plus one).  The PostScript driver in particular does large
	amounts of processing at this point (like resolving PostScript
	resources).  The problem is more theoretical for other output
	drivers, but done for consistency.

2024-02-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/string.cpp (string::string): When
	constructing a new string from a pointer to char, if the
	pointed-to-string doesn't exactly fit the storage reserved for
	it, populate the storage with null bytes before copying, to
	avoid reads of garbage heap memory.

2024-02-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/grops/psrm.cpp (resource::resource): Spell "file
	name" thus in diagnostic message.  It's English, not C.

2024-02-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/grops/psrm.cpp (resource_manager::output_prolog):
	Report underlying system error when `putenv()` fails.

	* src/devices/grops/psrm.cpp (resource_manager::output_prolog):
	(resource_manager::supply_resource)
	(resource_manager::read_download_file): Parallelize wording of
	diagnostic messages.

2024-02-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/grops/ps.cpp: Promote type definition to global
	scope and deanonymize it as `proc_table_t` so we can use it with
	`array_length` template.

	* src/devices/grops/psrm.cpp: Promote `comment_info` type
	definition to global scope so we can use it with `array_length`
	template.

	* src/devices/grops/ps.cpp (ps_printer::special):
	* src/devices/grops/psrm.cpp: Slightly refactor; migrate from
	`sizeof` and division operators to groff's `array_length`
	template function.
	(resource_manager::read_resource_arg, parse_extensions)
	(resource_manager::process_file)
	(resource_manager::print_extensions_comment): Switch types of
	loop indices iterating over these objects from `int`s of various
	signedness to `size_t`.
	(resource_manager::process_file)
	(resource_manager::read_download_file): Use `sizeof` operator
	idiomatically; it is an operator, not a function, and should be
	followed by parentheses only when making it operate on a type
	cast to get the size of a non-lvalue.

2024-02-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/pdf.tmac (pdfbookmark): Drop unused register storing
	computed length of `pdf:clean` string, `pdf:clean:len`.

2024-02-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_define_string, length_request):
	Drop redundant diagnostic message on invalid string identifiers.

2024-02-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[pdf]: Regression-test Savannah #65320.

	* tmac/tests/pdf_bookmark-starting-with-control-char-works.sh:

	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac_TESTS): Run test.
	(tmac_XFAIL_TESTS): Mark as an expected failure since resolution
	of this bug is blocked by resolution of Savannah #65322.

2024-02-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Implement `.it`, `.itc`, and `.itm` registers.  These
	read-only (and, in the case of `.itm`, string-valued as well)
	registers report the number of lines remaining in a pending
	input trap, a Boolean indication of whether that pending input
	trap honors output line continuation (cf. the `it` and `itc`
	requests), and the name of the macro associated with the pending
	input trap, respectively.

	* src/roff/troff/env.h (class environment): Declare new member
	functions to retrieve these data.
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp
	(environment::get_input_trap_line_count)
	(environment::get_input_trap_respects_continuation)
	(environment::get_input_trap_macro): Implement them.
	(environment::environment): Update constructors to initialize
	`input_trap_count` to "-1", as a hint that no input trap has
	ever been sprung in the environment.  (After one has, the count
	remains at zero and the name of the macro associated with the
	last trap that was sprung remains in `.itm`, until a new input
	trap is planted or explicitly cleared.)
	(environment::copy): Set the input trap line count to "-1".
	(do_input_trap): Update `it`/`itc` request handler.  Reset the
	input trap line count to "-1" and null out the associated macro
	name.  If the `it` or `itc` requests are given no arguments,
	this is the situation that persists.  Recast diagnostic message
	when attempting to set a nonpositive input line count.
	(init_env_requests): Hook up the new register names to accessor
	functions.

	[troff]: The `color`, `cp`, `linetabs`, and `vpt` requests now
	interpret arguments with negative values as instructions to
	disable the corresponding feature, using the *roff

	[man]: Back away from color management concerns.

	Hyperlink colors in PDF were showing a tendency to get "stuck
	on" when they shouldn't, and the extra difficulty of managing
	nested traps (`TP` followed by `UR`, for example) is proving
	tricky to sort out.  On top of that, the man(7) package
	historically has no cognizance of color issues and it doesn't
	seem like a good time to start, particularly if we only do it
	for the 'pdf' output device.

	* tmac/an.tmac (an-input-trap): Set stroke color to default
	after springing `TP`'s supporting trap.
	(an*begin-hyperlink, MR): Stop saving the stroke color.
	(an*end-hyperlink, MR): Stop restoring the saved stroke color.
	Set it to the default instead after formatting the link text.

2024-02-01  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: Fix Savannah #61434.

	* tmac/an.tmac: Support `UR`/`UE` and `MT`/`ME` hyperlinks as
	paragraph tags.
	(an*begin-hyperlink): Kick away the guard that prevented
	attempts to do so, now that support has been refactored in
	underneath it.

	* tmac/groff_man.7.man.in (Hyperlink macros): De-document lack
	of support for this.  Retain caveat that if the output device
	lacks hyperlink support, the hyperlink is typeset as part of the
	paragraph body rather than the tag.  I could not see any way to
	achieve the alternative given the way this package uses traps
	and diversions.  We might make a virtue of necessity by noting
	that paragraph tags could be lengthy, and URLs often will be,
	and it will be hella ugly to have the tag break.  Furthermore,
	if we implement automated generation of link anchors based on
	`TP` paragraph tags, not having their destination URLs in the
	tag text means we don't have to scrape them out later.

	* tmac/tests/an_link-macros-work-in-paragraph-tags.sh: Update
	test expectations.

	* tmac/an.tmac: Refactor.  Give `TP` its own trap.
	(an*TP-trap): New macro takes over some of the former functions
	of `an-input-trap` and `an-write-paragraph-tag`, ending the
	paragraph tag diversion, restoring the adjustment mode and line
	length, and calling `an-write-paragraph-tag`...

	output.

	* tmac/an.tmac: Refactor to distinguish visible hyperlinks from
	those that are sent only to device control commands.
	(an*begin-hyperlink): Rename existing string `an*hyperlink` to
	`an*visible-hyperlink`, which is the argument passed in via `UR`
	and `MT` calls.  Redefine `an*hyperlink` as the same argument,
	but with the `an*prefix` that its caller may specify.  (This
	feature is used to get the "mailto:" URI scheme into links but
	not clutter the page text with them.)
	(an*end-hyperlink): Use `an*hyperlink` in device control
	commands instead of the catenation of `an*prefix` and
	`an*hyperlink`.  When there is no link text, use
	`an*visible-hyperlink` for it.  Remove both of these strings
	when done with them.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description): Fix code style

2024-02-01  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac (an-end): Call `an-input-trap`.  If a document

	* src/roff/troff/env.h (class environment): Demote member
	function `do_input_trap`'s parameter type from `int` to `bool`.

	* src/roff/troff/env.h (class environment):
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (class environment): Demote member
	variable `continued_input_trap` from `int` to `bool`.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (class environment): Initialize member
	variable `continued_input_trap` with Boolean, not integer,
	literals.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (do_input_trap): Demote argument from
	`int` to `bool` in definition...
	* src/roff/troff/env.h (class environment): ...and friend
	function declaration.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (do_input_trap): ...and rename it from
	`continued` to `respect_continuation`.  Assign to
	`continued_input_trap` using Boolean literals.
	(input_trap, input_trap_continued): Call `do_input_trap` with
	Boolean literals.

2024-01-31  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/GMPfront.t: Save and restore the type size.  The effective
	base paragraph indentation was too large.  Since it is in ens,
	it turns out it was being calculated (as of the first man page
	rendered) based on the type size this cover sheet left it at,
	which was 16 points--a bit too big.

2024-01-31  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am ($(DOC_GNU_EPS)): Create "doc" destination
	directory before trying to create a file in it.  This bug has
	been latent (for out-of-tree builds) for ages, but has seemingly
	seldom or never arisen.  It seems that even in parallel builds,
	one of the many other "doc" targets that _did_ use the `MKDIR_P`
	make(1) macro nearly always won the race.  (In my experience, in
	builds from Git, the generated forms of our Texinfo manual could
	be relied upon to do this because they were near the root of the
	dependency tree; other groff targets tend not to depend on
	them.)  Anyway, fixed now.

2024-01-31  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am (DOCFILES_INST): Ship "GMPfront.t" in the
	distribution archive.

2024-01-31  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac (an*begin-hyperlink): Stop shutting off hyperlink
	support permanently if we hit one unsupported instance of `MT`
	or `UR` nested inside `TP`.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65233>.

2024-01-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/GMPfront.t: Support non-internal man page cross
	references.  Port over contemporary implementation of `MR` from
	"an.tmac" to its local replacement in this file.  Also remove
	conditionals on the `.T` string matching "pdf".  Instead test
	this register once at the beginning of the file and skip it with
	the `nx` request if it doesn't match.  This lowers the
	complexity and average indentation level of the file.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65231>.

2024-01-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/GMPfront.t: Bikeshed the collected man pages.  Retitle to
	"groff Collected Reference Pages".  Spell "groff" in full
	lowercase.  Favor requests over escape sequences.  Simplify
	means of setting page number.

2024-01-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am (doc/groff-man-pages.pdf): Register dependency on
	"doc/GMPfront.t".

2024-01-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac (MR): Support hyperlinked man page cross
	references in PDF.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?62933>.

2024-01-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (table::add_entry): Recast recently
	added diagnostic message.

2024-01-26  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	Changes to satisfy Savannah #65231.

	Alter build of groff-man-pages.pdf to use the new pdfmom,
	so that all forward references (i.e. reference to groff_font(5)
	in addftinfo(1) page) are handled properly. Also pass bookmark
	names as text strings.

	* doc/doc.am: Use pdfmom.
	* tmac/an.tmac: Pass parameters to .pdfbookmark as a string.

	New pdfmom, can now be used with all macros.

	Previously only useful for producing documents with
	mom.

	* src/devices/gropdf/pdfmom.pl: New --roff flag allows
	other macros (e.g. -ms) to be given on the command line.

	* src/devices/gropdf/pdfmom.1.man: Document the new facility.

	Front Cover for groff-man-pages.pdf

	Feel free to alter "artwork" at will (perhaps add maintainer
	information.

	* doc/GMPfront.t: Only used during build, not required as part
	of installation.

	Remove artifacts from using stringhex.

	Introduced in commit #e62b188aacb, betraying its origin
	from my deri-gropdf-ng branch which uses .stringhex.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl: minor fixes

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64060> (pdfmom needs
	`--help` option).

2024-01-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grog]: Fix Savannah #65227.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl (process_arguments): Match a 'C' only
	in a groff option cluster when deciding to enable compatibility
	mode, not any 'C' anywhere in any option.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65227>.

2024-01-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: Fix Savannah #65225.

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (table::add_entry): Fix regression
	in repeated glyph tbl(1) feature (`\R`), rendering it
	inoperative.  Problem introduced by me in commit 4f4b79b8aa, 26
	April 2022.  Restore logic to handle this table entry type.
	Also throw new error diagnostic if the repeated glyph token
	appears with no argument.  Also improve code style by reusing
	variable with already-computed entry string length instead of
	calculating it again.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65225>.  Thanks to the
	anonymous submitter for a reproducing case and a correct
	suggestion of the offending commit.

2024-01-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: Regression-test Savannah #65225.

	* src/preproc/tbl/tests/repeated-character-entry-works.sh: Do
	it.
	* src/preproc/tbl/tbl.am (tbl_TESTS): Run test.

2024-01-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: Refactor diversion management.

	* tmac/an.tmac (TH, an-write-paragraph-tag, an-input-trap, TP):
	Rename `an-is-in-diversion` register to
	`an*is-in-paragraph-tag-diversion`.
	(an-write-paragraph-tag, TP): Rename `an-div` diversion to
	`an*paragraph-tag`.
	(an*begin-hyperlink, an*end-hyperlink): Rename
	`an*link-text-div` to `an*link-text`.
	(an-write-paragraph-tag, an*end-hyperlink): Delete diversions
	after using them.
	(an*end-hyperlink): Revise emission of link text diversion.
	(TP): Throw warning if macro is nested with itself or `TQ`.
	(an*begin-hyperlink): Throw warning if hyperlink already inside
	diversion.
	(TH): Initialize `an*is-in-link-text-diversion` register.
	(an*begin-hyperlink): Set `an*is-in-link-text-diversion`
	register.  Use the register for its intended purpose.  If a
	nested diversion is attempted, clear `an*do-hyperlink` register.
	(an*end-hyperlink): Clear `an*is-in-link-text-diversion`
	register rather than deleting it.

2024-01-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac (MT, ME, UR, UE): Throw warnings on bad nesting.

2024-01-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac (an*begin-hyperlink): Repair damage I introduced
	in commit 6f12a82806, 27 January.

2024-01-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/doc.tmac (Mt): Give macro a real implementation instead
	of wrapping `Pa`.  Among other benefits, this means that it
	recognizes a `doc-Mt-font` string for styling of the argument,
	instead of using the styling applied to `Pa`.

	* tmac/mdoc/doc-ditroff (doc-Mt-font):
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-nroff (doc-Mt-font): Define new strings.  Set
	email addresses in roman by default.

	* NEWS: Report change in font styling.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60034>.

2024-01-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac:
	* tmac/doc.tmac: Slightly refactor.  Make the
	`an*is-output-html` and `doc-is-output-html` registers the
	{nearly} sole determinant (within each package) of behavior
	tailored for HTML output.  Annotate why we use each instead of
	testing `.T` string.

	* tmac/an.tmac (an*end-hyperlink, MR): Apply exceptions to the
	above rule when explicitly issuing device control escape
	sequences to embed HTML elements; only grohtml(1) can interpret
	these, not grops(1) when executed by pre-grohtml(1).

2024-01-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tests/doc_Lk-works.sh: Add unit test.
	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac_TESTS): Run test.

2024-01-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/doc.tmac (Mt, Lk): Validate arguments.

2024-01-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tests/doc_Mt-works.sh: Test "direct" `Mt` call.

2024-01-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac: Specialize `an*bookmark` macro by output device.
	(an*bookmark): Move former operation, conditional on 'pdf'
	output device, from here...
	(an*bookmark*pdf): ...to here.
	(an*bookmark): Make into a wrapper calling the device-specific
	macro.
	(an*bookmark*ascii, an*bookmark*cp1047, an*bookmark*dvi)
	(an*bookmark*html, an*bookmark*latin1, an*bookmark*lbp)
	(an*bookmark*lj4, an*bookmark*ps, an*bookmark*utf8): Define as
	empty strings.

2024-01-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac: Trivially refactor.
	(an*bookmark, an*header, an*footer, an*begin-hyperlink)
	(an*end-hyperlink, (initialization)): Retire `an*is-output-pdf`
	register (and interpolation-time checks of its value) in favor
	of (load-time) use of output comparison operator to check
	built-in `.T` string against value "pdf".

2024-01-26  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	Our documentation groff_man.7 documents that these requests are
	for hyperlinks. The .pdfhref W command expects the hotspot text
	to be passed as a parameter, but these pairs of requests enclose
	the required text. To solve this conundrum if the given
	hyperlink text to the .pdfhref request is the single pipe
	character "|" then mark all following text sent for output as
	the hotspot, terminate the hotspot on receipt of \X'pdf:
	markend' escape. This new facility is only available using -T
	pdf, not using -T ps and the pdfmark macros. Note the advice in
	the gropdf man page to use \X'pdf: marksuspend' and \X'pdf:
	markrestart' to protect any headers and footers becoming part of
	the hotspot in case the hyperlinked text crosses a page
	boundary.

	* tmac/an.tmac: add code to use .pdfhref W for these hyperlinks
	and protect against crossing page boundaries.

	* tmac/pdf.tmac: if the given text for a hyperlink consists of
	a single pipe character "|", start the hotspot and only
	terminate when \X'pdf: markend' is received.  Update hyperlink
	text color from RGB 0.35/0/0.6 to 0/0.35/0.6 (magenta-ish to
	cyan-ish).

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65215>.

	[troff]: Trivially refactor (trap Booleans).

	* src/roff/troff/div.h:
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Rename trap-related flags and
	boolify them.  Assign to them using Boolean literals.
	- `trap_sprung_flag` -> `was_trap_sprung`
	- `postpone_traps_flag` -> `are_traps_postponed`

	(postpone_traps, unpostpone_traps):
	Update variable access sites.

	* src/roff/troff/div.h:
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Demote return type of
	`unpostpone_traps()` from `int` to `bool`.
	(unpostpone_traps): Return Boolean, not integer, literals.

2024-01-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

2024-01-22  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am (doc/webpage.ms): Register dependency on
	"tmac/pspic.tmac".

2024-01-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (map_composite_character): Stop
	throwing diagnostic message when `composite` request invoked
	with only one argument.  This has long worked just fine to
	delete a composite character mapping.  That is something a
	{rare} user might conceivably want to do.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64937>.

2024-01-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Implement new `pcomposite` request.

	generalize and eliminate use of pointless temporary.  Continues
	commit e080a78c91, 5 January.

2024-01-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (encode_char_for_troff_output):

	from (and not encoded for) device control commands.

2024-01-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: Re-fix Savannah #62471 (vrules in nroff and no-space
	modes).

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (do_top): Compensate harder for
	non-intersected vertical rules occurring at the top of a table
	in nroff mode.  The previous strategy would fail if no-space
	mode was on and the drawing position was at the top of a page,
	provoking an error from grotty ("output above first line
	discarded").  Restore spacing before issuing `sp` request.

	Continues fixing Savannah #62471, and commit 6ccdab9d64, 29
	December.

2024-01-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: Add another test case.

	* src/preproc/tbl/tests/\
	do-not-overdraw-page-top-in-nroff-mode.sh: Add an eleventh test
	case, prompted by ascii(7) from Linux man-pages, where a table
	with a vertical rule got coincidentally rendered at the very top
	of a page (which can only happen in continuous rendering mode,
	where the page boundaries are invisible) while no-space mode was
	on (due to the table immediately following a paragraphing
	macro).

2024-01-14  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	[gropdf]: Retain plain ASCII labels when possible.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl: Do not use hexed label unless
	necessary.  Restores the ability for some PDF viewers to accept
	"#label" as suffix to the file name.

2024-01-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/tests/\
	device-control-special-character-handling.sh: Add unit test for
	this feature.  We want to be able to consistently pass (some)
	special character escape sequences to device control commands,
	and we want the `device` request and `\X` escape sequences to
	behave consistently with each other.
	* src/roff/groff/groff.am (groff_TESTS): Run test.

2024-01-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (encode_char_for_troff_output):

2024-01-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Restore diagnostic from groff 1.22.4.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (encode_char): Add `else` to `if`

	[gropdf]: Fix inclusion of PDF v1.7 files.

	PDF 1.5 introduced the object type ObjStm, which can contain a
	bunch of objects in its own compressed stream, but there is a
	restriction that an object with its own stream cannot be
	included into the ObjStm (i.e., no streams within streams).
	Gropdf has supported this for some years, but it has come to
	light that some PDFs have a "skeleton" object that contains the
	stream, while the rest of the object is held in an ObjStm.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (LoadPDF, ObjMerge): If a
	skeleton object exists at the top level and in an ObjStm stream,
	merge the two objects.

	I manually merged Deri's patch that wouldn't merge
	automatically, and I misread the magic constant "16" as "6".  My
	fault, but this is also one reason symbolic constants with
	human-readable names are usually preferred to numeric literals.

	[gropdf]: Fix Savannah #65112.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (subs_call): Type 1 fonts have a
	section of numbered subroutines which can be called from the
	actual glyph definition; I have seen over 1000 in some large
	fonts.  So, when you are subsetting you need to subset (and
	renumber) any relevant subroutines used by the glyph you are
	subsetting.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?65112>.

2024-01-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	for loop index.

2024-01-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/glyphuni.cpp: Trivially refactor.
	(struct glyph_to_unicode): Rename this...
	(struct glyph_to_unicode_map): ...to this.  We already have a
	_function_ called `glyph_to_unicode` in the code base and
	apparently it's not a name space conflict (despite groff making
	little use of any but the default name space), but it's
	definitely confusing when searching the code.

2024-01-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff, troff]: Refactor.

	* src/include/unicode.h: Rename function `check_unicode_name` to

	addition to "u1234" was undocumented and not even implied.
	* src/libs/libgroff/unicode.cpp (check_unicode_name): Rename

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (glyph_to_unicode)

	[gropdf]: Add font subsetting and Type 1 font parser.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl: There are two main areas of
	change.  The first is rectifying my design mistake in the
	original gropdf. It used the "t" command from groff as the
	primary command as a series of input characters which would be
	converted to postscript glyphs, all other text commands (for
	example "c") were converted back to their input character and
	treated as a single character "t" command.  I was focussed on
	the groff font rather than the postscript font.

	While thinking about font subsetting it became clear it made
	more sense to convert all input to postscript glyph names
	immediately, and use them as the "common currency" rather than
	focus on words.  This particularly makes sense when dealing with
	non-latin input which has been processed with preconv.  It is
	also makes it much more natural when dealing with font
	subsetting.  Previously this was not necessary because the whole
	font was embedded by gropdf.

	The second major change is the addition of a type 1 font parser
	and code to generate a font which only contains the glyphs
	required by the document being processed.  This is the area
	which needs the most testing.  I have tested with dozens of
	fonts that this parser is robust enough, but there are thousands
	of fonts out there.  It seems to be happy with fonts produced by
	fontforge, which is promising.

2024-01-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man,mdoc]: Increase default line length to 80n on terminals.
	The resolution of tbl(1) bugs such as Savannah #63749, #63640,
	and #62471 enables us to discard a decades-old convention of
	using 78n for the default line length when formatting for
	terminals; this was because tbl(1) would sometimes overset
	lines, with ugly consequences.  (I _assume_ this was the reason;
	no one ever seems to have gone on record about it--it was
	seemingly yet another case of Unix folklore that "everybody
	knew".)  Overset lines are still possible; tbl(1) will warn if
	so.  They can also overset if the document disables filling; the
	author is expected to know what they are doing in that case.

	* tmac/an.tmac:

	[tbl]: Fix Savannah #62471 (hrules in nroff mode).

	This fixes the last problem I know of that keeps man pages from

	cause lines to overrun manually, of course.)

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.h (class table): Define new enumeration

	uses a horizontal rule as a data row.
	* src/preproc/tbl/main.cpp (process_data): Set it when
	encountering appropriate input.

	* tmac/an.tmac (an-end): Horizontal rules in nroff mode _always_
	overdraw by one character cell; this is how grotty detects
	intersections with vertical rules at boundaries (see Savannah
	#62471).  Unfortunately it has unhappy consequences when drawing
	a rule that extends to the right margin.  Compensate by drawing
	the rule between consecutively rendered man pages nominally one
	en shorter than the line length, which turns out to be exactly
	the line length.

	The \X'ps: exec ...' for setlinejoin and setlinecap (which

	[gropdf]: Fix processing of catenated dit files (-Z).

	Normally it is safe to pass concatenated dit files to gropdf,
	typically this would be a separate source file which produces a
	custom cover and a different source for the body (different
	macro set?). Problem occurs if one of the dits uses the same
	fontno for a different font. Normally troff allocates TR to #5,
	but if one of the dits has been run with the flag "U-T" then
	U-TR is allocated to #5.

	* src/devices/gropdf/gropdf.pl (LoadFont): Check if "x font #
	name" has the same number AND name as a previously registered
	font, otherwise reload the font.

	* tmac/an.tmac (EE): Fix latent logic error; use `if` for
	conditional without an "else".  Since there was no subsequent
	`el` request, but the formatter was "primed" to expect one,
	this could conceal an `el` usage error in a man page document or
	otherwise behave strangely.

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::do_break)

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (set_special_fonts): Revert part of
	commit 44db6efc01, 3 November.  Stop throwing diagnostic and
	ignoring request if given no arguments; that's how you clear the
	global list of fonts designated as special by request (contrast
	with those that declare themselves as special in their
	description files).

2023-12-01  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Fix Savannah #64957 (`device`, `output` broken).

	The GNU troff(1) internal function `has_arg()` has a side effect
	of advancing the token pointer (a sort of cursor into the input
	stream).  So when I changed `device_request()` and
	`output_request()` to use `has_arg()` in commit 429723c3ec (10
	November), the first character of the argument got stripped,
	making it unintelligible to the output driver.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (device_request, output_request):
	Drop call of `has_arg()` in favor of `input_stack::peek()`.
	Manually discard space characters until reaching something else;
	if that is a newline or EOF, throw warning diagnostic as before.
	Otherwise, proceed with request processing.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64957>.

	[man]: Don't enforce tag separation on `IP`.

	The marker argument to the `IP` macro is often very short, such
	as a bullet or list enumerator (and in fact we encourage this
	practice in our style advice, promoting `TP` instead for
	definition lists and similar).  We therefore don't want to
	enforce the `TS` tag separation for them.  `.IP \[bu] 2n` is a
	perfectly cromulent usage pattern.

	* tmac/an.tmac: Add new Boolean-valued register,
	`an*enforce-tag-separation`, to control this aspect of state.
	Initialize it true.
	(an-write-paragraph-tag): Multiply `TS` by this register to

	Inspired by a debugging process (that ultimately involved

	we've dropped altogether from our Texinfo manual (mainly a
	somewhat stale duplicate of groff_man(7), which no GNU Info
	partisan would read anyway) or were empty stubs anyway.  An HTTP

	(ref*add-B, ref*add-O, ref*add-A, ref*add-V, ref*add-N)
	(ref*add-dflt): Fix thinko in `ie` predicates.  The true
	branches of the conditionals were never taken because the
	condition was consistently misspelled, testing for the existence
	of, for example, a register named "ef*spec!J:\\$1" (where `\\$1`
	_would_ be interpolated, but not improve chances of success).
	Fix by using the `d` conditional expression operator as
	obviously intended.  This enables some refer(1) formatting
	customization that was unfortunately inoperative.  Problem
	appears to date back to commit 3bab8e6fe5, 2011-01-28.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64779>.  Thanks to an
	anonymous bug submitter for the report and the patch.

2023-10-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/devps/generate/Makefile (zapfdr.afm): Fix typo in
	dependency name.  Problem introduced by me in commit 2566b64e0b,
	13 March 2022, which claimed "[s]hould not cause regressions
	because the Make targets invoked are never called during a build
	{they are isolates that you have to manually name on the command
	line}."  Thus was fortune's hostage seized.  Apparently
	OpenSUSE uses this Makefile as part of its "ghostscript-fonts-
	grops" package build.  (Fair enough--we _do_ install it.)

2023-10-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	(while_continue_request): Clarify diagnostic messages.

2023-10-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.  Rename and boolify some file-local
	functions.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (get_delim_number): Rename this...
	(read_delimited_number): ...to this, and boolify it.  The idea
	behind "read" instead of "get" is that the latter more strongly
	implies (to me) that the value being "got" is returned by the
	function.  But for `read_delimited_number`, the number is stored
	{after possible unit conversion} in one of the function
	parameters.
	(get_delim_name): Rename this...
	(get_delimited_name): ...to this.
	(token::next): Update call sites.

2023-10-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::next, device_macro_request):
	Recast language of one of groff's more notorious diagnostics,
	eliminating the much-abused word "transparently".  Also name the
	offending token.  It is difficult to overstate how unhelpful
	diagnostic messages are when they know precisely what is wrong
	but refuse to tell the user.

2023-10-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::next): Tweak language of
	diagnostic message when encountering unsupported escape

	* doc/groff.texi (Using Escape Sequences): Update example
	accordingly.

2023-10-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (font_change): Trivially refactor,
	renaming this function...
	(select_font): ...to this.  Doing so aligns with other use of
	the term "select" in groff font documentation.  Further, when
	formatting for typesetters, fonts can be "changed" in a
	different sense by altering height, slant, (constancy of)
	spacing, and magnification.  Also mark function as "static"; it
	needs no visibility outside this translation unit.

2023-10-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Throw error diagnostic on attempt to select a font
	named "DESC".  That will never work.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (font_change):
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::next): Do it.

2023-09-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: Add bespoke handling of `lbp` device.

	* tmac/an.tmac (EX): Refactor, using new register
	`an*unmap-fonts` to keep track of whether we're remapping fonts
	instead of switching families.  Like TeX DVI, the LBP output
	device lacks a (complete) monospaced font family.  In EX/EE
	examples on that device, remap the bold-italic face to italics.
	(EE): Revert remappings and remove `an*unmap-fonts` register.

	Prompted by discussion with pandoc developers at
	<https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/9020>.

	* src/preproc/pic/troff.cpp (strsame): Add utility function for
	comparing two C strings for identical content, handling null
	pointer arguments as `strcmp()` does not.
	(troff_output::set_location): Refactor; write the two-argument
	form of the `lf` request if the current and last seen file names
	_don't_ match.  Problem introduced by me in commit 705be31107,
	29 July.  Also fix heap memory leak when repeatedly updating
	`troff_output::last_filename` member variable.

	(troff_output::start_picture): Save stroke and fill colors.

	"grn" and "soelim" to be built first.  Also add dependency on
	`$(TMAC_PACKAGE_MS)`.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64681>.  Thanks to

	`readonly_boolean_register`.

2023-09-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Add class for Boolean-valued read-only registers.
	Their values have been stored variously in `readonly_register`,
	which has full `int` range, and in normal string registers, as
	with `.A`.

	* src/roff/troff/reg.h (class readonly_boolean_register): Add.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp
	(readonly_boolean_register::readonly_boolean_register)
	(readonly_boolean_register::get_string): Define.

2023-09-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Trivially refactor.  Rename some
	functions and recast diagnostic messages.
	(open_mac_file):
	(process_macro_file): Rename these...
	(open_macro_package):
	(process_macro_package_argument): ...to these.

	As our documentation now makes more clear, "macro packages" are
	a subset of "macro files", and have additional rules regarding
	their handling (where they are sought and how their names are
	rewritten).

2023-09-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Trivially refactor.  Rename

2023-09-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/groff_me.7.man: Fix error in summary of "safe" groff

	lines, not output lines.

2023-09-05  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Explicitly construct `default_color`.

	Without explicit construction, link-time optimization feels free
	to send this object into the twilight zone, subtly changing the
	semantics of the current and previous stroke and fill colors,
	making their registers interpolate "default" instead of empty
	strings.

	* src/libs/libgroff/color.cpp: Construct `default_color` with
	empty string instead of leaving uninitalized.  Problem appears
	to date back to commit ea5a42d080, 2002-01-24.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64421>.  Thanks to Günther
	Noack for the report, a good reproducer, identification of
	`-flto=auto` as the free variable in our experiments, and
	artifact production beyond the call of duty; Peter Schaffter for

	pointers in the right direction (twice!).

2023-09-05  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac (np, bu): Throw diagnostic if given arguments; we

	(sk): Genericize existing diagnostic to use `\$0` to report its
	own name.

	[eqn]: Implement "reset" keyword.

	* src/preproc/eqn/box.cpp: Use `static` storage class for
	parametric defaults, moving them to file scope from global.
	Rename `param_table` array of structs to `default_param_table`.
	Use the length of this array for iteration since it is known at
	compile time.  Convert `param_table` to a null pointer.
	(set_param): Update diagnostic message text.
	(reset_param): New function restores a rendering parameter in
	`param_table` to its corresponding value in
	`default_param_table`.
	(get_param): New function accesses `param_table` entries via a C
	string rather than integer lvalues.  Use `assert()` to dump
	core if the parameter name is not recognized; this function is
	never called by the parser, but only by static logic.  Add
	`fatal()` under this same circumstance, in case anyone
	`#define`s `NDEBUG`.
	(init_param_table): New function populates the (mutable)
	`param_table` from the (immutable) `default_param_table` using
	heap storage.
	(free_param_table): New function avoids memory leak by freeing
	the heap storage allocated for `param_table`.
	* src/preproc/eqn/eqn.h: Drop external declaration of `nroff`.
	* src/preproc/eqn/eqn.ypp: Add new token `RESET`.
	* src/preproc/eqn/lex.cpp: Map C string "reset" to token `RESET`
	in untagged struct `token_table`.
	(do_reset): Handle new keyword; if argument valid, call
	`reset_param()` with it.
	(yylex): Hook up token `RESET` to `do_reset()`.
	* src/preproc/eqn/box.h: Declare `reset_param()`, `get_param()`,
	`init_param_table()`, and `free_param_table()`.

2023-08-22  Dave Kemper <saint.snit@gmail.com>

	* tmac/pic.tmac (PY): Call `PF` rather than duplicating its
	{three bytes of} code.  This is almost too trivial to DRY, but
	{1} the new form is a cue to the human reader that .PY is meant
	to be an alias of .PF; and {2} .PE was already defined as a
	variant of .PF with an explicit call to it, so this makes the
	.PY definition conform to that precedent.

	* tmac/an.tmac: Stop setting `an*can-hyperlink` if formatting

	* src/devices/grops/ps.cpp (ps_printer::define_encoding):
	* src/devices/grops/psrm.cpp (resource_manager::output_prolog)
	(resource_manager::supply_resource): Report more intelligible
	diagnostics when libgroff's `font::open_file()` returns a null
	pointer without setting `errno`.  The only way this can happen
	is if it rejected the file name for containing a slash, thus
	attempting directory traversal (recall Savannah #61424).  Also
	fix code style nits: explicitly `#include` errno.h C standard
	library header, align style of null pointer checks, and stop
	explicitly setting `errno` to zero before (indirectly) calling
	`fopen()`; we inspect `errno`'s value only under a documented
	error condition (a null stream pointer).  See errno(3).

	* NEWS: Add item; we should have mentioned this (and produced
	these better diagnostics) when 1.23.0 was released.
	Distributors may find this change desirable to backport.

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_PAGE): Slightly refactor, and help users to
	figure out how the "configure" script decided upon the paper
	format it did by supplementing the `AC_MSG_RESULT` message.  If
	not falling back to the "letter" default or honoring a
	command-line setting (e.g., "./configure PAGE=a4"), report which

	[man]: Deprecate `SB` macro.  It is a SunOS 4.0 (1988) extension
	that in most contexts, does nothing you can't achieve with `SM`
	and `B` together (in either order).

	Study of the SunOS 4 man page corpus suggests a reason for its
	introduction of this macro: use of `SB` immediately after `TP`
	was common (610 out of 2,111 occurrences).  The problem with
	`TP` and the mechanism suggested above is that input traps in
	troff normally ignore the `\c` escape sequence, the use of which
	would be necessary to get the desired effect.  In groff since
	1.22.4, the man(7) `TP` macro uses GNU troff's `itc` request,
	which _does_ respect `\c`.  (mandoc(1) 1.14.2 and later behave
	compatibly with groff man >= 1.22.4.)  Solaris 11 switched to
	groff as its man page formatter, so there is no reason for newly
	written or currently maintained man pages to employ `SB`.

	* tmac/an.tmac (SB): Throw deprecation warning.

	* tmac/groff_man.7.man.in (Description): Move macro from table
	to deprecation list.
	(Font style macros): Move description from here...

	[docs]: Revise material in our Texinfo manual.

	* doc/groff.texi (Manipulating Filling and Adjustment): Document
	a CSTR #54 erratum; the arguments to the `ss` request are in
	12ths of the selected font's `spacewidth` parameter, not 36ths
	of an em.  Drop false claim of rounding of `.ss` and `.sss`
	register values on terminal devices.  (Rounding of any resulting
	adjustment quantities might still occur, but this is part of the
	usual application of motion quanta and not particular to the
	`ss` request.)  Characterize "undiscardable space" as
	"horizontal motion" to help the reader acquire this essential
	distinction between horizontal spaces and motions.
	(Manipulating Spacing): Clarify behavior.  Distinguish `sp`
	request from `\v` escape sequence and cross reference the
	latter.  Recast to squeeze presentation of `ss` request onto one
	U.S. letter page when typeset.  Drop (commented-out) trivial
	example of `ls` usage in favor of new example illustrating some
	macros using `vs` instead, for pedagogical purposes and to eat
	up a lot of dead space on the page caused by a later lengthy
	example.  (Knuth-Plass for the...uh...win.)
	(Page Control): Stop (arguably) mis-applying the term "widow",
	in favor of less metaphorical language.  Extend Woolf example to
	narrow the seas of vertical space produced by TeX's formatting
	of the page it occupies.  (Our blanched discourse can use the

	Slightly refactor.

	[grodvi, grops, xditview, libbib, libgroff, eqn, pre-grohtml,

2023-05-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: Refactor handling of type size and vertical spacing.

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.h (struct inc_number): Rename this...
	(struct size_expression): ...to this, and change its member
	types.  The `inc` `short` becomes a `relativity` enum
	because it only ever takes 3 values.  The `val` short becomes an

2023-05-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/tbl/main.cpp (process_format): Accept (and
	discard) space and tab characters after [pPvV] in a column

	the same loop style as the others, for consistency.

	and '~' input tokens.

	* src/preproc/eqn/box.cpp: Add globals `half_space`,
	`full_space`.
	(struct S): Recognize "half_space" and "full_space" as
	parameters to the "set" primitive, and map them to the globals.
	(half_space_box::output): Format the half space width.
	(full_space_box::output): Format the full space width.
	(full_space_box::output, thick_space_box::output): Drop

2023-05-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Fix Savannah #64166.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (bold_font): Add `WARN_MISSING`
	diagnostic if request given no arguments; it does nothing, and
	the behavior of this request is sufficiently complex that it's
	worth saying so.  Stop throwing font lookup error if second
	argument cannot be resolved as a font name; it might be an
	emboldening amount instead.

2023-05-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/s.tmac (PE): Turn on no-space mode after a pic(1)
	display, when not flying back with `PF`.  Continues fix for

2023-05-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::~token, token::operator=):

	operator.

2023-05-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Fix Savannah #64104.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (set_escape_char): Rename this...
	(assign_escape_character): ...to this.  Don't permit the escape

	control characters.
	* doc/groff.texi (Using Escape Sequences): Document
	restrictions.

	* src/roff/troff/env.h (class environment): Slightly refactor.
	Rename fields `control_char` and `no_break_control_char` to
	`control_character` and `no_break_control_character`,
	respectively, and make them private.  Add public getters and
	setters for them.
	(get_control_character): New public member function returns
	`unsigned char`.
	(set_control_character): New public member function takes an
	`unsigned char` and returns a `bool`.
	(get_no_break_control_character):
	(set_no_break_control_character): Similar.
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::environment): Update
	constructors to use new field names and initialize them in their
	new order of declaration.
	(environment::copy): Similar.  (Not to be confused with a copy
	constructor, this member function implements the operation of a
	valid `evc` GNU troff request.)
	(environment::get_control_character):
	(environment::set_control_character):
	(environment::get_no_break_control_character):
	(environment::set_no_break_control_character): Implement.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp: Drop handling of `cc` and `c2`
	requests.
	(control_char, no_break_control_char): Drop implementations.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Resurrect handling of `cc` and `c2`
	requests here, with more error handling.
	(assign_escape_character, process_input_stack): Use the new
	getters defined above in environment object since the relevant
	fields are now private.
	(assign_control_character): New function assumes the former
	responsibilities of `env.cpp::control_char()` and rejects the
	request if the desired character is already the escape or
	no-break control character.
	(assign_no_break_control_character): New function assumes the
	former responsibilities of `env.cpp::no_break_control_char()`
	and rejects the request if the desired character is already the
	escape or control character.
	(process_input_stack): Reorder comparisons to avoid inadvertent
	lvalue assignment.  Add parentheses to assignment with complex
	RHS.
	(init_input_requests): Attach `cc` and `c2` requests to new
	functions above.
	* doc/groff.texi (Control Characters): Document restrictions.

2023-05-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Don't quote a character with itself in diagnostics.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description)

2023-05-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.

2023-05-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Revise output warning diagnostic format.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_error): For the `OUTPUT_WARNING`
	value of the `error_type` enum, spell out the words "page" and
	"diversion" instead of abbreviating them, and place the
	diversion information (if present) in parentheses.

	[troff]: Drop `POPEN_MISSING` preprocessor macro.

	3 source files test this macro but nothing appears to define it.
	It dates back to (at least) 1994.  I suspect this of being
	bitrot.  Reasons include: (1) We test for a declaration of
	`popen` in our "configure.ac" file; (2) our gxditview command
	uses `popen` _without_ #ifdef-guarding it (perhaps the
	assumption was that any system that supported X11 also had a
	working `popen`); (3) our "nonposix.h" header file defines a
	macro aliasing `popen` to `_popen`, which is its typical name on
	Windows systems, and is the most likely build host candidate for
	which support might have been missing as late as 1994.
	Microsoft end-of-lifed MS-DOS in 2000.  If someone wants to
	start up a FreeDOS port, talk to us.  Maybe even that has a
	functional `popen()`.  Here's hopin'.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp ([global], file_iterator::close)

	* src/preproc/eqn/main.cpp (main): Prefix generated *roff
	diagnostics with name of input file (the document).  Use
	`tmc`/`tm1` to coalesce multi-line diagnostic onto one line of
	output to stderr.  Tighten wording.  Continues the long process
	of fixing Savannah #52463.

	Ingi Gislason for the report.

2023-04-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::description): Revise
	construction of description of printable ordinary input

	[troff]: Make futile aliasing an error.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (alias_macro): Promote diagnostic
	when attempting to alias a nonexistent macro/string/diversion
	from warning to error; this aligns with the handling of the
	requests `chop`, `stringup`, `stringdown`, `substring`,
	`asciify`, `unformat`, and `writem` when they are regarded as
	impossible.  Further, attempting to alias a nonexistent object
	does not create an empty one, unlike interpolating it; try ".als
	baz qux", then ".pm".
	* src/roff/troff/reg.cpp (alias_reg): Promote diagnostic when
	attempting to alias a nonexistent register from warning to
	error.  Attempting to alias a nonexistent register does not
	create an empty one, unlike interpolating it; try ".aln q r",
	then ".pnr".

	[tbl]: Trivially refactor.  Rename variables and functions to
	use the term "rule" rather than "line".  The value of the term

	[tbl]: Fix Savannah #63838.

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (table::add_entry): Throw error
	diagnostic if table entry ends in the zero-motion escape
	sequence `\z`.  This is nonsense and provokes baffling
	diagnostics from the formatter.  Stick user's nose directly into
	the problem.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?63838>.  Thanks to the

	test.

	[build]: Improve portability to non-GNU, non-LLVM compilers.

	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add "attribute".
	* src/libs/libgroff/getopt.c:

	[man]: Preserve user-selected font family.

	* tmac/an.tmac: When initializing, save the currently selected
	font family as `an*body-family` instead of forcing 'T' (Times,
	which is the formatter's default, even on nroff-mode devices
	that can't switch families).  This change makes the formatter's
	`-f` option work on man(7) documents again (important for
	Japanese man pages, but there is now once again nothing stopping
	you from viewing man pages in Palatino or Helvetica on the 'ps'
	and 'pdf' devices where these families are available).  It also
	reopens an avenue for rogue pages to affect the rendering of
	unrelated documents later in batch rendering, but there are many
	other, and worse, ways for rogue pages to do damage.  Problem
	introduced by me in commit e0e16d8e65, 15 March 2022.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64130>.  Thanks to Deri
	James for the report.

	if we are starting a (non-nested) synopsis.

	Thanks to Alex Colomar for the report.  Problem introduced by me
	in commit aea1dfb11b, 6 March 2022.

	[pdfpic]: Refactor.

	* tmac/pdfpic.tmac: Migrate gathering of image dimensions from
	`sy` and a temporary file to `pso`.
	(pdfpic@cleanup): Drop `pdfpic*temporary-file` string.
	(pdfpic@get-image-dimensions): Remove redirection.  Invoke
	`pso`, not `sy`.
	(PDFPIC): Stop constructing `pdfpic*temporary-file` string.
	Stop testing `systat` register.  Stop sourcing and deleting
	temporary file.

2023-04-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/pdfpic.tmac: Refactor to make comprehensible some
	woefully undocumented cleverness and improve efficiency.
	(PDFPIC): Break out flaming-hoop-leaping "clever" bit of `sy`
	usage into its own macro, calling from here and relocating its
	requests from here...
	(pdfpic@get-image-dimensions): ...to here.  When using `sy`
	request to collect and munge output of pdfinfo(1), (a) disable
	the escape character while defining the macro; (b) construct the
	command in a roff string, appending to it in discrete, hopefully
	comprehensible chunks; (c) disable the escape character during
	macro interpretation wherever possible (most of it); (d) retain
	doubled backslashes so that they survive subsequent string
	interpolation; (e) stop using grep(1) in the pipeline when
	sed(1) is perfectly capable of performing its own input
	filtering; (f) invoke sed with '-n' option and emit output only
	upon a successful substitution; (g) replace unportable(!) POSIX
	BRE character class '[:digit:]' in substitution match text with
	'[0-9]'; and most importantly (h) replace multi-line sed 's'
	replacement text (see below for the reason we can't use it) with
	single roff control line employing the groff extension escape
	sequence `\R` to assign multiple registers.  Annotate
	portability and escaping challenges.  Tested on GNU/Linux, macOS
	12, and (with simulated pdfinfo(1) output) Solaris 11.

	There is a problem with trying to embed true newlines into the
	arguments of a `sy` request.  The C++ function that GNU troff
	uses to assemble the command string (character by character)
	_does not recognize C/C++ string literal escape sequences_.
	This means that you _cannot_ embed "\n" in `sy`'s arguments and
	have it survive, as a newline character, into the command string
	passed to the standard C library's system(3) function.  ("A\nB"
	gets encoded as 'A', '\\', 'n', 'B', not 'A', '\n', 'B'.)
	Unfortunately, this appears to be AT&T troff-compatible
	behavior.  But it means that you _cannot_ portably construct
	multi-line replacement text for sed's 's' command.  (Other sed
	commands like 'a', 'c', and 'i' will be similarly affected.)
	See Savannah #64071.

	* PROBLEMS: Drop item.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64061>.  Thanks to Bruno
	Haible for the report, and to him and Ralph Corderoy for the
	discussion of portable and efficient sed constructs.

	[pdfpic]: Clean up better.

	* tmac/pdfpic.tmac (PDFPIC): Call `pdfpic@cleanup` before
	returning when falling back to `PSPIC` for non-PDF documents.

2023-04-05  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tty.tmac: Add angle bracket fallbacks.

	[tmac]: Add Spanish language support (2/5).

	* tmac/es.tmac: Spell weekday and month names in lowercase;
	every style authority I could find online mandates this, and it
	meshes with my half-remembered formal instruction in the
	language.  Fix groff composite special character escape
	sequences to place the base character first.  Replace one
	Unicode special character escape sequence with a composite
	special character escape sequence, for consistency.

2023-03-13  Eloi Montañés <em@ilsrv.com>

	[tmac]: Add Russian language support (4/7).

	* tmac/koi8-ru.tmac: Rename this file...
	* tmac/koi8-r.tmac: ...to this.  There _is_ a "KOI8-RU"
	encoding, which appears to subsume KOI8-B and KOI8-U (by
	replacing more box drawing characters), but this file does not
	remap their values to applicable Unicode code points.

	"configure.ac".  Also stop `AC_SUBST`ing it; we don't need
	"@use_grohtml@" in our Makefiles since an `AM_CONDITIONAL` in
	configure.ac already does an equivalent thing.  Continues commit
	aa5787c1eb by me from 20 May.
	(PROCESSEDDOCFILES): Drop "$(PROCESSEDDOCFILES_HTML)" from macro
	definition; annotate why.

	m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_TMAC): Eliminate garbage leading space from
	contents of `tmac_wrap` shell variable.

2023-03-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[build]: Clarify output of `GROFF_TMAC` Autoconf test.

	* configure.ac: Correct characterization of the list of macro
	packages reported.  It is not the list of macro packages
	receiving a "g" prefix, but the list of macro packages reciving
	a wrapper macro file in groff's macro directory, each of which
	sources the corresponding system (likely AT&T-descended troff)
	macro package.  Fixes wording I introduced in commit 4d30dd7424,
	31 May.
	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_TMAC): Clarify first "checking" message:
	we are looking for a file name prefix on existing system macro
	packages (like "tmac.").  This has nothing to do with the prefix
	applied to groff commands, or the "g" prefixed to groff
	implementations of the man, mm, and ms packages.  Tighten
	wording of second "checking" message.  Consistently say "(none)"
	instead of "none" or "none found".

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?63900>.

2023-03-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am (install-txt): Look for "groff.txt" in the source
	and build directories in sequence; it could be in either place
	depending on whether the build is from the Git repository or
	from a distribution archive.  Annotate this.  Fixes
	"install-doc" target when building from Git repository.  Problem
	introduced by me in commit 691fc70108, 22 February.  Thanks to
	Nikita Ivanov for the report.
	(install-pdf-local, install-html-local): Similar.

	Also fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64059>, later
	reported anonymously.

2023-03-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am (maintainer-clean-local): Remove temporary "*.t2d"
	and "*.t2p" directories created by texi2dvi.

2023-04-20  Bruno Haible <bruno@clisp.org>

	[build]: Fix gxditview linking on AIX.

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_X11): Add macro dependency on
	`AC_CANONICAL_HOST`.  Introduce new variable `X_AW_DEPS`, empty
	on most hosts.  If we otherwise have Athena widget library
	support, and the host is AIX, force linkage against Xpm and Xext
	libraries to reflect modern Athena dependencies, which AIX's
	linker doesn't figure out on its own.  `AC_SUBST` this variable,
	exposing it to Automake files.
	* src/devices/xditview/xditview.am (gxditview_LDADD): Use it.

	{A similar change might also be useful for HP-UX, another Unix
	System V descendant; see
	<http://hpux.connect.org.uk/hppd/cgi-bin/wwwtar?/hpux/Gnu/\
	groff-1.23.0/groff-1.23.0-src-11.31.tar.gz+groff-1.23.0/\
	HPUX.Install+text>.  --GBR, 2023-07-10}

2023-04-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add "sys_wait" module.  MinGW
	does not provide "sys/wait.h", which we require in
	src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp since commit 11137209ed, 27 June.

2023-04-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: Initialize (as empty) Automake variables that we
	don't use but which gnulib modules expect to be defined.
	(AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS, SUBDIRS, noinst_HEADERS, noinst_LTLIBRARIES)
	(pkgdata_DATA, MOSTLYCLEANDIRS, AM_CFLAGS): Do it.

	Thanks to Bruno Haible for the advice.

2023-04-22  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[mdoc]: Regression-test Savannah #57665, but for mdoc.

	* tmac/tests/doc_TS-do-not-keep-tables-when-cR-set.sh: Do it.
	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac_TESTS): Run test.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64037>.
