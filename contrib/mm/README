This file is part of mm, a reimplementation of the Documenter's
Workbench (DWB) troff memorandum macro package for use with GNU troff.

It is supposed to be compatible with DWB mm, and has several extensions.

Please submit bug reports using groff's 'BUG-REPORT' file to

Any new ideas or improvements are welcome.

This README should be bigger :-)
