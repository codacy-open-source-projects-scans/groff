This file describes how to prepare 'groff' for a new release.


########################################################################

* Update 'grog' to include the names of new GNU troff requests and macro
  names unique to packages (and sufficiently heavily used in typical
  documents).

* Update font description files that we generate from external data and
  provide with our source distribution.

    Directory  Format                  Tool
    ---------  ------                  ----
    devX*      X11 core/server font    xtotroff

  The make(1) target "maintainer-font-descriptions" produces these font
  descriptions.

* Retrieve current versions of 'UnicodeData.txt'[1] and the Adobe Glyph
  List (AGL)[2], and use them with
  'src/utils/afmtodit/make-afmtodit-tables' to update
  'src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.tables'.

  [1] E.g., <https://www.unicode.org/Public/15.0.0/ucd/UnicodeData.txt>.
      Check for the latest _released_ version of Unicode at the time.
      Data for the forthcoming release may be available.
  [2] <https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/agl-aglfn/blob/master/\
      glyphlist.txt>

     (<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adobe-type-tools/agl-aglfn/\
     master/glyphlist.txt> may be more convenient.)

* Use the same 'UnicodeData.txt' file as input to
  'src/libs/libgroff/make-uniuni' to regenerate
  'src/libs/libgroff/uniuni.cpp'.

* Update the 'gnulib' sub-module and 'bootstrap' script to the latest
  stable versions.  See the 'HACKING' file for instructions.

* Update the release version number where it is hard-coded.
  + NEWS
  + BUG-REPORT
  + arch/mingw/grap2graph.cmd
  + doc/webpage.ms

* If the major or minor version number is being incremented, split off
  a historical ChangeLog file and add it to `EXTRA_DIST` in Makefile.am.

* Update in 'src/roff/groff/groff.cpp' the 'printf' that displays the
  copyright to include the current year if it is not present.  (If no
  copyrightable changes to the project's code have been made in the
  current calendar year, use the most recent year in which they have;
  see the 'HACKING' file.)

* Increment the version number by tagging the release, beta, or release
  candidate.  groff requires an explicit three-part version,
  major.minor.revision, due to the .Y register.

    $ git tag 1.23.0.rc1

* Run the "set-man-page-time-stamps" Makefile target from your build
  directory to fix up the stamps on the man pages.
