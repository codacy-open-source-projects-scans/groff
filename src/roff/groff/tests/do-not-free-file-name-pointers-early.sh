# File name strings in GNU troff tend to be dynamically allocated and to
# have highly variable lifetimes.  Aggressively freeing them can lead to
# undefined behavior (referencing deallocated memory).
#
# Because we're talking about dynamic memory UB, the following input may
# not reproduce bad behavior in all environments.  On GBR's system, the
# following is evident prior to the bug fix.
#
# {"name": "CE", "file name": "a", "starting line number": 2, ... }
# {"name": "CE", "file name": "\u0090\u0092\u009B\u00CE6V", ... }
#
# ...where the garbage in the file name varies with every run.
