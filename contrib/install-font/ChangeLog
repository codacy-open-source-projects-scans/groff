	* install-font.am: Drop unused macros `installfont_srcdir` and
	`installfont_builddir`.  Automake itself doesn't require them,
	and we never interpolate them.

	* install-font.bash: Import Peter Schaffter's "install-font.sh"
	script from his website.  Rename as shown; its "shebang" line
	declares it a Bash script (albeit one that operates in Bash's
	POSIX mode).  Cosmetic changes to Peter's version comprise
	removal of trailing whitespace, a replacement of the GPL license
	notice with model language from the current version of the GPL,
	and addition of a Vim modeline reflecting the code style in
	evidence.  I also recoded the file to plain ASCII (Unicode Basic
	Latin), the only consequence of which was dropping of the U+00A9
	copyright sign.
	* COPYRIGHT: Add file promised by groff's "LICENSES" file.
	* install-font.am: Automake script, when driven by a groff
	build, installs "install-font.bash" to the target's "examples"
	directory.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60930>.
