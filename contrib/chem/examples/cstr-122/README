This directory contains the examples for the chem language written
in the Bell Labs paper CSTR #122.

    Computing Science Technical Report No. 122
    CHEM - A Program for Typesetting Chemical Diagrams: User Manual
    by Jon L. Bentley, Lynn W. Jelinski, Brian W. Kernighan

Historically, this paper was available at
<http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cstr/122.ps.gz>.

Many of the examples had to be fixed.  Unfortunately, the AWK version of
chem version does not run on many of these files.  The Perl
version of chem distributed with groff does.

Most examples do not use a modern style of depiction.  They show carbon
atoms explicitly, whereas contemporary practice omits all C atoms and
their bound hydrogen atoms.  [A chemist should fact-check this.  --GBR]

The examples are named and sorted by the section whence they are found
in CSTR #122.  For example, the file 'ch4c_colon.chem' [sic] means an
example in section 4; the 'c' indicates that it is the third example in
this section; the name 'colon' is used to describe the content of the
example.

Render the examples with "groff -j".
